In our previous 42 Interactive Blog post on [the X-Ray Plugin tutorial](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/3-tips-on-using-x-ray-plugins), we provided the step-by-step instructions on how to use this awesome plugin. Here we want to show you how it will actually work on your 3D project.

We are using a 7-seater car in this project showcase to help visualize how the x-ray effect, of our X-Ray Plugin, will make it easier for users to follow and apply.

This plugin will allow you to customize important elements of the x-ray pointer. It enables you to adjust the angles (front, rear, up, down, and side views), but you can also play around with the colours and the width of the pointer.

Another highlight of [X-Ray](https://gargleblastergames.com/xray/) Plugin is you can place the positioning of the pointer as well as alter to use as one big pointer or multiple smaller pointers around the car body part.
