Can you believe that we are now in December and close to the end of 2020?

It has been 12 months of the strangest of years for everyone globally handling the Covid Pandemic.

Here we would like to share the stories of ups and downs that we have been through in 2020.

## January: Journey to the Future

Stepping into 2020 was an exciting start to the year. With some major pitches from 2019 finalised we were ready for our highly dedicated and enthusiastic teams in Bali and Sydney to execute on some of our Partners' projects.

## February: Embracing New Projects and Pitches

February was an exciting month where we had new inquiries came in for the [42Interactive team](https://www.42interactive.com/about-us) to workshop and scope.  We also had  2 large projects greenlighted to start. We assembled, discussed, and conquered. Milestones were set, releases communicated for client approval and then the design and development fun began.

## March: Then This Happened - COVID Pandemic

## May: **Adapting to the "New" Normal - Tech Innovation**

Here comes the most significant turning point of technology, probably ever. With businesses were closed (or some on the brink of bankruptcy) due to the pandemic while people have bills to pay and mouth to feed, challenges arise in how to keep business afloat. People were seeking an innovative, convenient, and safest way to conduct commerce and human interaction.  And technology answered it with an online virtual meeting room. [**Zoom**](https://zoom.us/) has become a major trend around the world and being used by people in all segments of life.

Do you use Zoom? If not, what online meeting provider that you have at home?

## June: Adapting to Covid

In this stage, we came to realize that Coronavirus won't be gone anytime soon. It's either we adapt and overcome, or we will lose the battle. We saw rising cases and sadly also increasing death tolls during this time. Drastic measures and changes were taken and so the Glory days of office work have since been replaced with the virtual world. The word "New Normal" has been invented and introduced worldwide. The majority of nations executed full international and domestic lock-downs, some nations implementing stricter rules than others.

## July: Sitecore Collaboration
