Last year, specifically in Australia, we endured loss and pain caused by [bushfires across states](https://www.australia.gov.au/bushfire-recovery).

Then worldwide, we all suffered a great impact, caused by **COVID-19**.

The crisis requires a **deep and careful financial planning** for at least **2 years ahead**. Many businesses are **closed down** due to this pandemic. Many people have **lost their jobs**, while many continue to struggle to get back on their feet after a few months in lockdown. But we have to **thrive and strive** to move forward.

With challenges come **adaptation and solutions**. As **physical contact** was and is still restricted in some countries, people have moved to meet **"online"**. **Technology and digital improvements** play a big role and have reached a **far wider market** than if things in 2020 continued to be "normal".

We see the **spiking trend** of **online sessions** being held and used by everyone globally. **Online conferences** are now not the privilege of (IT) professionals only; families, friends, and colleagues who were not familiar with these [digital tools](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/what-is-digital-working-and-the-benefits-digital-nomads) and [software applications](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/how-to-use-technology-in-classroom-to-enhance-teaching-learning) pre-COVID-19 are now enjoying the **sophisticated benefits** offered by technology.

Look at **online shopping websites** that have increased their **sales income** within months, due to people staying at home and spending more time in front of their computer than the average days before COVID-19.

And then [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/). Who doesn't know this application by now?

Be smart and fast to answer this **new digital trend** if you want to win the biggest part of the cake.

Consider to enlist **technology** into your business (or personal) **financial planning expenses**; **purchase**, **expansion**, and **maintenance** to keep moving through 2020 and beyond.

Stay safe and make some digital magic.
