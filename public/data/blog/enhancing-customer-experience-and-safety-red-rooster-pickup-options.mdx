**Interested in how 42 Interactive integrated Red Rooster Pickup options to elevate both customer experience and safety?**

‍

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for safe and contactless dining experiences became paramount. Red Rooster, a popular fast-food chain owned by Craveable Brands, faced the challenge of limiting in-store interactions while still providing convenient options for their customers. As their trusted digital solutions provider, [42 Interactive](https://www.42interactive.com/) stepped in to implement a comprehensive solution that addressed these concerns. The agency introduced three pickup options - in-store, drive-thru, and kerbside pickup, to their existing delivery-only ordering website.

‍

**The Client**

‍

Craveable Brands is a Quick Service Restaurant franchising company that owns three iconic Australian food brands: Red Rooster, Oporto, and Chicken Treat. Those who are unfamiliar with Red Rooster, it is an Australian chain of fast-food restaurants that specialises in roast chicken. It was founded in 1972 and has over 360 locations across Australia.

‍

**Our Solutions**

‍

42 Interactive devised and implemented the following [three pickup options](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-product-service-development) to complement Red Rooster's existing delivery service:

‍

**a. In-Store Pickup:** Customers can place orders through the website and select the "In-Store Pickup" option. Upon arrival, they can collect their order from a designated pickup counter within the restaurant. This option reduces wait times and facilitates a seamless order pickup process.

**b. Drive-Thru Pickup:** For customers who prefer the convenience of staying in their vehicles, the "Drive-Thru Pickup" option allows them to place orders and pick them up without leaving their cars. This feature was integrated into the ordering website, streamlining the drive-thru experience and increasing customer satisfaction.

**c. Kerbside Pickup:** The "Kerbside Pickup" option enables customers to place orders online and have their meals delivered directly to their vehicles while parked outside the restaurant. This contactless option minimises in-person interactions, ensuring a safer dining experience for customers and staff alike.

‍

**The Results and Benefits**

‍

The [implementation](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/craveable-brands-restaurants) of these pickup options had significant positive impacts on Red Rooster's operations and customer experience:

‍

**a. Enhanced Safety and Contactless Payments:** By offering multiple pickup options, Red Rooster successfully reduced in-store interactions. The "In-Store Pickup" option ensured that customers spent minimal time inside the restaurant, while "Drive-Thru" and "Kerbside Pickup" eliminated the need to enter the premises altogether. Additionally, with the integration of contactless payment methods, such as mobile wallets and card payments, customers could complete transactions without the need for physical cash handling, further promoting a contactless environment.

‍

**b. Social Distancing and Customer Confidence:** The introduction of the "Kerbside Pickup" option allowed customers to maintain a safe distance from others, mitigating the risk of virus transmission. This safety measure garnered trust and confidence among customers, resulting in increased repeat visits and positive word-of-mouth promotion.

‍

**c. Streamlined Operations and Customer Convenience:** The diversified pickup options optimised Red Rooster's operational efficiency. The "In-Store Pickup" reduced congestion inside the restaurant, while the "Drive-Thru" and "Kerbside Pickup" reduced wait times and provided customers with a hassle-free experience. As a result, the overall customer satisfaction level improved significantly.

‍

**d. Adaptability Beyond the Pandemic:** Although initially introduced in response to the pandemic, these pickup options proved to be highly adaptable beyond the crisis. Even as restrictions eased, customers continued to embrace the convenience and safety of these contactless pickup methods.

‍

**Conclusion**

‍

The strategic collaboration between Red Rooster and 42 Interactive resulted in a successful and innovative solution to address the challenges posed by the pandemic. The implementation of three pickup options - in-store, drive-thru, and kerbside - not only enhanced customer safety but also improved overall operational efficiency. By remaining responsive to changing circumstances and customer needs, Red Rooster and 42 Interactive demonstrated their commitment to providing exceptional dining experiences even during challenging times.
