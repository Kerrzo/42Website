We live in a data-driven world. Massive amounts of data are used to tell the story of the world around us.

The good news is that creating visual data does not require a large team of data scientists. With Google Data Studio, you can now create highly engaging reports that all stakeholders can understand. 

## What Exactly is Google Data Studio?

GDS belongs to the Google Analytics 360 Suite. It is a free data visualization and business intelligence (BI) product from Google, that allows you to connect to and report on data from hundreds of sources. A Google Data Studio dashboard can easily be connected to pull in Google Ads spend, YouTube traffic, and everything you've set up in Google Analytics (goals, segments, and traffic sources).

Data Studio can provide [SEO](/services/digital-marketing-services) insights to eCommerce merchants and shops, resulting in valuable eCommerce metrics. This allows you to track everything from referrers to purchase value in a single control panel. These useful information insights can make a difference in increasing your earnings when selling items online.

## How Can Data Studio Assist Your Online Store?

### Unsuccessful Campaigns Can Be Spotted Easily

One of the fantastic features of Data Studio is the availability of chart options that are not readily available in Google Analytics. The scatter chart is one option in Data Studio that is useful for e-commerce data.

By viewing cost-to-revenue comparisons with a trendline using data that is already available to us within a complete enhanced e-commerce implementation. We can quickly see which of our ads are performing above and below the average for the site. You will be able to easily identify which ads require your attention and which can be increased in spending with this type of visualization.

### Social Engagement And Ecommerce Attribution 

Because Data Studio supports connectors other than Google Analytics, you can visualize data from other sources, such as Facebook and other social networks. You can have your social data automatically sent into a Google Sheet at regular intervals by connecting to your social accounts using a tool like [Supermetrics](https://supermetrics.com/). Data Studio includes an easy-to-use connector for displaying and visualizing data from Google Sheets!

You can use Google Sheets to display not only your data from your social network accounts, but also your revenue from Google Analytics that has been attributed to your social channel traffic. Because each chart and visualization in Data Studio can be linked to its own data source, you can easily filter your Google Analytics Revenue metric to only show data from the Channel of Social. This will demonstrate not only how your social influence is growing, but also how it is influencing your ecommerce revenue results.

Aside from providing an overview of your social performance, you can also analyze your social data to gain a better understanding of specific points within your efforts across your social platforms. As an example, see how we can use social data from Google Sheets to analyze the effectiveness of Facebook posts above. It displays the number of posts made each day of the week, as well as the number of posts made by type and the number of reactions (likes, shares, and comments) received by each post. This can help you determine which types of posts and days of the week are most likely to reach your target audience.

### Analysis And Interactivity 

When analyzing expanded e-commerce reporting within Google Analytics, we are all aware that there is a lot of data to evaluate. Another significant advantage of using Data Studio for enhanced e-commerce data visualization is providing the viewer with the ability to apply filters immediately within the report.

This feature allows your report's viewers to filter and examine the data in more relevant ways. Furthermore, when you apply filters to specific charts inside your report, the filters will only effect the charts with which they have been grouped. This allows you to have not only report and page level filters, but also [interactive](/) chart particular filters.

### Linking Your Data

Data Studio not only allows you to connect data from numerous sources, but it can also be used to display the connections between your data from the same Data Source. Data Studio, for example, provides reports that would usually require loading many different reports to be examined side by side in a single report when using your Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce data. This enables us to view charts and stats at a look in order to obtain an understanding faster than analyzing the data across various reports in Google Analytics directly.

With a wide range of options and visualizations available within Data Studio, websites that use Google's Enhanced Ecommerce should not overlook the ability to report on their data beyond the standard Google Analytics reporting. Enhanced Ecommerce tracking provides a rich dataset of information, and adding Data Studio reporting to your arsenal will enable you and your team to gain more insights from your data.
