#### **Five years of designing and developing great digital experiences through the creative use of technology for clients, our own products, and services.**

‍

It has been an eventful five years at 42 Interactive. We grew strong years by years thanks to the clients that continually trusted us to deliver their digital transformation, amazing partnerships, and passionate skilful employees.

‍

We’ve launched a [pain clinic](https://neurotechnology.com.au/), [theatre streaming service](https://boxofficevr.com/), we helped to [future proof a food franchisee](https://www.craveablebrands.com/)

and [won few awards for a workplace precinct](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/international-towers-digital-ecosystem-project).

‍

We are committing to high-quality delivery and working at pace is part of the reason 42 interactive has been growing since our beginning in 2017 and we are not stopping here.

‍

We are now more motivated and excited about what the future will bring – we will welcome challenges, highs, and lows with grateful hearts.

‍

We are staying true to our vision: **Building world firsts through the creative use of technology**. Also, our mission: **To connect people through innovative digital experiences**. As we continue to look to the future, we strive for designing and developing better products and services, in an effort to solve real-world problems and to help businesses be future-ready.
