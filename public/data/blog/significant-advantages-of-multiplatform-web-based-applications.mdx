## **What is a Web App?**

‍

A web App is an application program stored in a remote server that can be run directly using a browser through the internet. It doesn't require a local storage nor having compatibility issues with operating system or hardware. There is also that we know as web services; which are websites that contain many web apps. So, in short, any component on a website that is accessed through a browser that users can run some function without being required to be installed first can be considered as a web app.

It is designed for many purposes, have numerous applications and can be used by anyone for plenty of reasons; be it at organisation level or simply for individuals. We have all known some web applications such as webmail, online calculators, online ticketing or e-commerce shops. However, some web apps requires a specific browser in order for it to function properly; but, most web apps can be run using any available browsers nowadays .

Web apps have gone through many revolutionising transformations throughout the decades since it was first introduced by Netscape through a client-side scripting language called Javascript in the 1990s.

A web-based application uses the website as its primary interface. This is called as the front-end. The web app can be run from any computer that is connected to the Internet (or intranet), without the need for the application to be installed on the user's PC/laptop. Hotmail is known as one of the best web-based application that is capable of performing exactly the same functions as its Outlook's desktop application.

## **Types of Web Applications**

Web applications have revolutionized the way we interact with the internet. They are software programs that are accessible via web browsers, and they can perform a wide range of functions. There are several types of web applications available in the market today.

One of the most common types of web applications is multiplatform web-based applications. These are applications that can be used on different operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. They are designed to be accessed through a web browser, and they don't require any software installation on the user's computer.

Another type of web application is the single-page application. These applications are designed to be loaded entirely on a single web page, and they use dynamic loading to update the content without requiring a page refresh. They are often used for social media platforms and online games.

E-commerce web applications are another type that is widely used today. They are designed to facilitate online purchases, and they often include features such as shopping carts, payment gateways, and order tracking.

Content management systems are also popular web applications that allow website owners to manage and publish content without requiring technical expertise. These applications usually come with built-in templates and plugins that make it easy to create and maintain a website.

## **Architecture of Web Applications**

Web applications are software programs that are accessed over the internet using a web browser. These applications are designed using a specific architecture, which is responsible for managing the user interface, the application logic, and the data storage. The architecture of web applications can be divided into three main layers: the presentation layer, the application layer, and the data layer.

The presentation layer is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user. This layer consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for creating the look and feel of the application. The presentation layer also interacts with the user, receiving input and providing output.

The application layer is responsible for managing the application logic. This layer is where the processing of user input takes place. The application layer is responsible for validating user input, executing business rules, and generating output.

The data layer is responsible for managing the data used by the application. This layer is responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating data. This layer also interacts with the application layer to provide the data needed by the application.

Multiplatform web-based applications are designed to work on multiple platforms, such as desktop computers, mobile devices, and tablets. These applications are designed using responsive web design, which allows the application to adjust its layout to fit the screen size of the device being used. This makes multiplatform web-based applications accessible to a wide range of users, regardless of the device they are using.

## **Advantages of Web-based Applications**

As mentioned earlier, web apps have numerous applications since it can be designed for many purposes. Therefore, we can gain many benefits through the use of web applications in today's technological era; to name a few are:

**1.Wider Compatibilty**

A web based application has more compatibility across many platforms than the installed software. In general, the minimum requirement for a web app is a web browser and internet connection. Two things that are very common. As for the browsers, user can access the web app through known web browsers (eg. Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, etc.). But, the key point here is that user doesn't need to have a high-end hardware or latest operating systems to run the web app.

**2.Web apps are manageable**

In order for a web app can be run by users, it needs to be installed on the server. This makes it easier for the developers to maintain as well as to update the system. Thus making it simpler to deploy any updates.

**3.Simpler deployment**

As mentioned earlier,  web app is manageable and it's also simpler to deploy any updates. Once updates are deployed, user only need the web address. Thus, allowing one to widen access to various systems, streamline processes and improve relationships by providing access to customers, suppliers and any third parties.

**4.Data is highly secured**

Fora large and complex systems, it needs to carry more data and have separate systems and data sources. However, for a web app, these systems and processes can be consolidated. This is reducing the need to have separate systems. Web apps provide an additional layer of security by removing user's access to the data and back end servers.

**5.Low cost**

A web based applications can lower production cost due to the reduced need for support and maintenance, requirements client-side system and simplified architecture. Additional savings can be gained by streamlining the business operations through the use of web apps.

**6.Multiplatform**

A web-based application have wider compatibility. It is built to work across various platforms and any hardware. The platforms mentioned herein is referring to the different operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS and even mobile OS! It's safe to say that web apps are platform independent.

## **Technologies Used in Web Applications**

Web applications have become an essential part of our daily lives, and they are powered by various technologies. In this article, we will explore the different technologies that are commonly used to develop web applications.

The foundation of any web application is its programming language. Among the most popular programming languages for web development are JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP. These languages have various frameworks and libraries that make it easier to develop web applications.

In addition to programming languages, web applications also require databases to store and retrieve data. Common databases used for web applications include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

Another important technology for web applications is the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs allow different applications to communicate with each other, enabling features like authentication and data sharing. REST APIs are commonly used in web development.

Finally, to make web applications accessible across multiple platforms and devices, multiplatform web-based applications are developed using technologies like React Native and Ionic.

## **Significant Advantages Of Multiplatform Web-Based Applications**

A web-based app is expected to perform smoothly across many platforms. It can run exactly the same function on a Windows PC as it is on a Macbook or on an Android phones by using web browsers. In today's technological era that has diversified into so many sectors, the challenges to reach a target audience have increased. Most common questions faced are 'What platform mainly used by users around the world?' or 'Can the users on the other side of this world access my app?' Since a web-based application is platform independent, such questions can be easily answered.

An excellent example of popular web apps are Hotmail, Google Docs and Evernote. These web-based applications are easy to maintain, can update on their own, it doesn't have to be downloaded, and do not require app store approval.

The platform compatibility of your web-based app has a direct impact on your end users. Fortunately, we are able to tackle compatibility issue as the web-based apps can be used on multiple platforms.

When your web app can work on any device, anywhere in the world and at anytime the users desire, more users can be expected! This is especially beneficial for online shopping and services. A web-based app that works on multiple platforms has a greater acceptance by users. Thus, a business that is using web-based apps can expect quicker turnaround. There is also the benefit of faster ROI with a higher number of users. Cross-platform apps have taken the lead from native apps.

Web-based apps take advantage of cloud space and are not limited by the storage space on your server. Additionally, they have just one set of code; which is easy to maintain.

## **Challenges in Web Application Development**

Web application development has come a long way in recent years, but it still comes with its fair share of challenges. One major challenge is creating multiplatform web-based applications that are optimized for different devices and screen sizes.

Another challenge is keeping up with rapidly changing technologies and platforms. With new frameworks and tools constantly emerging, it can be difficult to determine which ones are worth investing in and which will soon become obsolete.

Additionally, web application development requires close collaboration between developers and other stakeholders, such as designers and project managers. Ensuring effective communication and coordination can be challenging, especially when team members are working remotely.

Security is also a major concern in web application development. With so much sensitive data being transmitted online, developers must prioritize implementing robust security measures to protect against cyber attacks and data breaches.

Finally, web application development can be time-consuming and expensive, especially when attempting to create complex applications. It requires a lot of planning, testing, and iteration to get things right, which can sometimes result in delays and added costs.
