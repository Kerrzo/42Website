**Sandy Balls Cricket is a fun game of speed, skills, and a bit of luck, just like cricket.**

This fun mobile game was inspired by the [cricket](https://gargleblastergames.com/sandyballscricket-2/) scandal #sandpapergate that happened a few years ago. In the Australia vs South Africa cricket match one of the Australian players used some sandpaper to rub the cricket ball so create more swing in the ball for the bowler.

This cheating by a national sporting team caused an outcry in Australia and across the world.
