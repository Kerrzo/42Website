**What is a search engine?**

Let us now look at the formal definition of a search engine. Search engines are web-based tools that allow users to search the internet for content based on keywords they enter and find webpages that contain content related to the search.

Google is the most widely used search engine. It is, however, not the only one. Other search engines include Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex.

It is critical to understand how these search engines operate. Assume you create a website and want to share it with a larger audience or have it appear in one of Google's top searches. How do you go about doing that? For this purpose, you must be able to understand how search engines work, organise, and analyse content.

**How do search engines work?**

Most search engines operate in three steps:

**_Crawling_** - Search engines scour the internet using programs known as spiders, bots, or crawlers. They may do this every few days, so content may be out of date until they crawl your website again.

**_Indexing_** - Using 'keywords,' the search engine will attempt to understand and categorise the content on a web page. Following SEO best practices will assist the search engine in understanding your content, allowing you to rank for the appropriate search queries.

**_Ranking_** - A variety of factors are used to rank search results. Keyword density, speed, and links are examples of these. The goal of the search engine is to provide the most relevant results to the user.

Although most search engines will give you advice on how to [improve](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy) your page ranking, the exact algorithms used are closely guarded and change on a regular basis to avoid abuse. However, by adhering to best practices in search engine optimisation (SEO), you can ensure that:

  

-   Your website is easily crawlable by search engines. You can also request that they crawl new content.
-   Your content is indexed for the appropriate keywords, allowing it to appear in relevant searches.
-   Your content has the potential to rank highly in search results.

**Where Does SEO Fit In?**

SEO is a strategy that assists search engines in better identifying websites and in getting websites in front of relevant searchers. SEOs can increase the number of indexed pages by ensuring that the website's code is readable, easy to navigate, and functional for spiders. However, just because your website is indexed does not guarantee that it will appear in search results; this is where SEO comes in.

SEO [agencies](https://www.42interactive.com/about-us) do a variety of things to demonstrate a site's relevance and persuade search engines that it should rank on the first page. This makes it much easier for search engines to understand what the pages on the website are about and to place the results in front of relevant queries.

That is how search engines operate! A very condensed version of a very complex process; however, thanks to search technology and algorithms, we can get immediate answers to our searches anywhere in the world with a single mouse click. Keep looking, searchers!

**Summary**

In this article, we learned how search engines work and examined some features of Google's search engine. SEO was also briefly introduced, emphasising the significance and necessity of understanding the search engine mechanism.
