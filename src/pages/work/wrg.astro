                <a href="https://whiterabbitcollection.org/">The White Rabbit art gallery</a> is a premier destination for anyone interested in 21st-century Chinese contemporary art. With over 3000 works by 700 different artists, the collection offers something for everyone. The gallery was founded by Judith Neilson, who was inspired to establish it after her first trips to Beijing in the late 1990s. She was thrilled by the idea of a society that is so different from what she had seen in Australia.
