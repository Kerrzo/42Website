#### Discover how Cypress Automated Testing helped streamline Red Rooster's brand and ordering websites in a successful merging project.

‍

This case study highlights the benefits of leveraging **automated testing** to simplify **complex projects**, **reduce errors**, and consistently deliver **high-quality results**. Learn more about how this [innovative](https://www.42interactive.com/) tool can help your business **optimise its operations**, **strengthen customer satisfaction**, and stay ahead in today's **competitive digital landscape**.

‍

**Craveable Brands** is a Franchisor company that owns three iconic Australian food brands: **Red Rooster**, **Oporto**, and **Chicken Treat**. In this project, we focus on the development of the **Red Rooster website**. Those who are unfamiliar with Red Rooster, it is an Australian chain of fast-food restaurants that specialises in roast chicken. It was founded in 1972 and has over **360 locations** across Australia.

‍

As a **QA engineer**, we encountered a major obstacle during the merging project - **regression testing**. This was particularly challenging due to the **amalgamation of two websites**, which included multiple **functionalities**, **integrations** and **user flows** that had to be meticulously examined for seamless and error-free operation.

However, using **traditional manual testing methods** proved to be **time-consuming**, **labor-intensive** and vulnerable to **human error**. This presented significant challenges in terms of meeting **project deadlines** while ensuring adequate **quality control** for the merged website.

‍

To tackle the complexities of **regression testing**, we made a strategic decision to use **Cypress**, a cutting-edge and potent **end-to-end testing framework**. With Cypress on board, we were able to **automate our testing process** effectively and ensure that it was both **robust and dependable**.

Our approach encompassed creating an extensive set of **automated tests** using Cypress that explored various scenarios. These included **user-related flows**, **product browsing experiences**, **cart functionalities**, **checkout processes** - as well as **integrations with third-party services** - all thoroughly tested by our comprehensive suite of Cypress automated tests.

‍

The incorporation of the **Cypress automated testing tool** revolutionised our merging project. Thanks to its capabilities, we were able to **enhance our testing efficiency** significantly by running tests simultaneously across various **browsers and devices**, thereby reducing the **testing duration** considerably.

Additionally, Cypress offered us **comprehensive test reports** that enabled us to quickly **identify and rectify** any potential problems, therefore guaranteeing a **top-quality merged website** with enhanced functionality.

‍

**Cypress testing framework** has been a lifesaver for our **QA team**, especially when it comes to **creating and maintaining tests**. With its **user-friendly and intuitive interface**, even those with limited **programming experience** can easily navigate and use the platform to write **test scripts**.

The syntax of Cypress is both **clear and descriptive**, meaning that even **non-technical team members** can quickly understand what's happening in the code which encourages **collaboration across teams**. This allows all parties involved to make **informed decisions** about any improvements or changes that might be required during **development cycles** - making everyone's job easier!

‍

Utilising **Cypress automated testing** in our merging project proved to be a **game-changer** for our development team. With its **fast feedback loop**, developers were able to validate the **functionality and integration** of different components and modules of the newly merged website reliably and efficiently.

The **Cypress tests** acted as a **safety net** during the development process, allowing developers to quickly detect any issues before they made it into production - this saved countless hours that would have otherwise been spent **troubleshooting bugs** later on. Whether running locally or on a **continuous integration server**, utilising Cypress testing helped developers **identify flaws early** in the development cycle so that they could dedicate their time towards improving **overall product quality** rather than constantly fixing errors after deployment.

‍

Thanks to the **fast feedback loop** provided by Cypress, our development team was able to quickly **identify and resolve** any bugs, errors or inconsistencies in **real-time**. This meant that we could spend less time **debugging and fixing issues** later on in the project, resulting in a more **efficient and streamlined development process** overall.

With **faster identification and resolution** of problems, we were able to **improve code quality** and increase **stability** for the merged website - ultimately contributing towards a more **successful end product**.

‍

Thorough **Cypress's testing reports**, developers were able to **identify issues quickly** and take **corrective actions**. This **collaborative approach** between QA and development teams resulted in **better communication and coordination**, thereby enhancing the integration of **brand and ordering websites**.

The ability to **catch bugs early** using Cypress automated testing allowed for **fewer errors in production environments**, resulting in a **stable website** for Red Rooster's customers. As a result of this effort, the team was able to deliver a **reliable product** that exceeded expectations while working collaboratively and seamlessly through every phase of development.

‍

Overall, the integration of **Cypress automated testing** proved to be beneficial for the **QA team** in guaranteeing the **website's quality**, and it also provided **precious insights** for the development team. By quickly identifying issues and **enhancing code quality**, they could improve their **overall development process**.

With Red Rooster's successful implementation of Cypress automated testing, they were able to seamlessly merge both their [brand](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/craveable-brands-restaurants) and ordering websites, providing an **elevated online experience** for loyal customers while establishing themselves as a **leader in the fast-food industry**. This achievement undoubtedly proves how incorporating **advanced technologies** can bolster any company's **performance and success rate**.
