First, I'd like to emphasize that this review focuses on the **user experience** of the **Samsung HMD Odyssey** and **Windows Mixed Reality** as its system. This is not a pure tech review.  

## **What is a Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) headset?**

The **WMR Mixed Reality** term was coined as a marketing jargon for Microsoft's new breed of **Virtual Reality headsets**. These are new **Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) VR headsets** ranging from **Acer**, **Dell**, **HP**, **Lenovo** and **Samsung** with others upcoming, supported by **Microsoft Windows** and their Mixed Reality development team.

It's a [VR headset](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-vr-and-which-headset-you-should-buy) with a little bit of **Microsoft Hololens technology** built into it.

### The Technology

I'm not going into the nitty-gritty details of its **product specifications**. You can have a read on [Samsung's product page](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/hmd/windows-mixed-reality/xe800zaa-hc1us-xe800zaa-hc1us/) including its **price point**. It is more **consumer-friendly** compared to the **Oculus Rift** or **HTC VIVE** which are selling at a higher price.

In short, it is a nice VR headset with **AMOLED screens** at **1600x1440px resolution** for each eye. The headset and lenses provide us with **110º field of view** and has with **front facing cameras** to track the controllers and scan the room.

It also includes **two controllers** with **LED tracking dots** on their crown.

All the controllers in the **WMR range** are currently the same. Each brand just has a new logo imprinted on the controller.

It is the **highest resolution consumer VR headset** in the market at the time this is written.  

### The Hardware

The design is great, it looks slick and more appealing than other OEM devices.

#### **Setup**

Setting up was easy, with only **one cable** coming out from the headset to the PC. The **play area set up** and controllers **Bluetooth syncing** with the PC were a breeze too. You will need to be running **Windows 10** with the creators' update (currently the latest version of Windows).

**Windows Mixed Reality software** also needs to be downloaded but that doesn't take that long. Once they are all installed with the headset plugged in, there's nothing else we need to do. You are ready to use the **VR headset**.

#### **Cable length**

Compared to **HTC VIVE**, the cable is quite short and suitable for a **2 - 3m² interactive space**. It does have a nice cable that splits to **HDMI** and **USB 3+** at the back.

#### **Headset**

The headset is really comfy with nice soft **faux leather** around the eyes.

The **head strap tightening mechanic** is similar to **Playstation VR** and **Hololens**. Rotate a wheel at the back to tighten the head strap, making it **super simple** to put on and take off.

One good thing about this adjustment mechanism is that it allows **people with glasses** to use the headset. It's quite light compared to **HTC Vive** despite it being the heaviest in the range of WMR headsets.

Samsung Odyssey adopted **Hololens style** of tracking the play area and the controllers called **inside-out tracking**. However, it seems to be hit and miss as we discuss further in the review.

Great headset with lots of soft cushioning

#### **Screens**

Gorgeous **1600x1400px resolution** for each screen. The lenses in front of the screen are also refined to a state where we can't see any **concentric circles**.

This really made the headset shine. Everything looks **crisp** with the **higher resolution**. **Text in the user interface** is legible and very easy to read, **3D environment textures** with text can also be read easily. It really does make a big difference as the **pixels just disappear** and our eyes get used to the environment faster.

This is the **biggest selling point** of this headset. This can only be matched by the announced **HTC Vive Pro** that is coming later this year.

The screens inside this headset are second to none.

Castle Must Be Mine by TheMiddleGray. This VR tabletop gaming experience is a great example on how the screens can display text beautifully.

#### **AKG Headphones**

I can't really review the **sound quality** as I'm not a certified audiophile, but from a regular perspective they're great, however not as adjustable as I'd like them to be. They have a minor **circular movement**, but it can't be extended or retracted, so it may not fit everyone's head well.

Having a **built-in headphone** is always a good thing because it's less fussy cables to deal with. However, if it's not that adjustable, it's better to just have **3.5mm headphone jack** to use your own headphones or earphones.

Great headphones but not that adjustable.

Fantasynth by HelloEnjoy, immersive musical experience was great to test the headphones.

#### **Controllers**

The controllers are comfy to hold and **ergonomically designed**. In comparison it sits between **Oculus Rift's Touch controllers** and **HTC Vive's**. Rift's controllers are the best for **user experience** and more ergonomically designed, it's a **clench style controller** so it doesn't strain your wrist or palm.

Vive's controllers are a lot stiffer, like holding maracas it's tiring after a long use. The **WMR controller** used by the Odyssey is lighter but not as light as Oculus'.

One flaw of the design is the **LED lights** that are on the crown of the controller, when they're not used, they're **blindingly bright**. When they're seen by the headset, they're dimmer.

Odyssey’s controllers, ergonomically designed, looks like they’re wearing a sombrero hat.

### The Software or WMR System

This is where **Samsung Odyssey** and other **WMR products** fall short.

#### **Windows Mixed Reality**

If you've used **Hololens** before, this application feels familiar. The **User Interface** is similar to Hololens, the environment is gorgeous and the control uses standard VR patterns like **teleportation** and **boundary detections**.

Installation is straight forward and when we put on the headset or turn on the controllers the **WMR app** opens automatically and puts you into the **"Home"** or the dashboard to access all of your apps in VR.

Games and apps can be bought and downloaded from the **Windows Store** and **Steam**. The new ones are built with **Universal Windows Platform (UWP)** technology and should be available for the **Xbox One platform** as well. This creates an interesting theory that in the future Xbox may be able to use WMR headset to play VR games, especially now that **project Scorpio** has been released. Currently the most powerful console on the market.

#### **Steam Compatibility**

I was ready to go and try out a few games available from the **STEAM store**. Then the issues started to arise as I was expecting that it would just work.

On STEAM we need to download **Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR app** that becomes a bridge between any WMR device and STEAM. Not a big deal at first but then I realize that my machine gets a bit confused on which app is the priority as there are **two VR environments** running at the same time.

Some Steam [games](/about-us) and apps work fine with the Odyssey but if they go out of sync they'll go to a state where it's unplayable. Some issues I experienced: **wrong floor height**, **dipping in or out of game** and **losing controller tracking**. I'm sure with time it's going to be a lot better when WMR for SteamVR app (the bridge) is updated, however it locks us into the **Windows store** if a user wants a seamless experience, and this will be an ongoing struggle for a consumer who has WMR headsets. Their **VR library** is getting fragmented across multiple marketplaces.

### Performance

#### **VR Games**

Games look great on the **Odyssey's screens**. They run well too with a **good PC setup**.

As mentioned before, **compatibility** can be an issue where games dip in and out of the applications because there are **two environments** running at the same time, WMR and Steam VR apps.

**Standing and room scale VR games** work well when they're optimised for WMR, the easiest way to recognise if they have the **WMR symbol** in the library. If not then the controllers will be in the shape of Vive's controllers and they may have a minor **bounding box issue** in the game. This will cause users to **misjudge the distance** of objects when they're trying to grab them in game.

#### **VR Movies**

Similar to VR games the **quality of the screen** makes the colour pop, it's **vivid and enjoyable** to watch. The **AKG headphones** make the **surround sound** work to a degree. Either the apps haven't been designed with full surround sound or not implemented at the software level to make me hear **full surround sound** not just stereo.

‍

Google Spotlight Stories: Special Delivery. This VR movie is just so captivating. It’s beautifully crafted and entices you to keep on coming back.

‍

#### **Room Scale or Sitting Down**

Both interactivity is acceptable, with the **room scale experience** being slightly smaller than the Vive's due to **cable length**. **WMR software** is also slightly behind the Vive's with the **boundary detection** needing to be improved.

I was hoping that it would detect like Hololens does, **scanning the room** and remembering where the tables, chairs and walls are, but it doesn't do so or it's just not there yet.

**HTC Vive** uses its headset cameras to display a rough outline of the real world so you won't run into walls or furniture, it's a **handy tool** to have in a limited play area. Odyssey doesn't do this yet so occasionally I would knock the controllers on my PC desk or a nearby chair.

Worth noting that if you set your **play area boundaries**, don't go too close to the furniture or walls, keep a **good margin** from them during setup.

#### **Tracking**

During the time I've tested the Odyssey, I have had **mixed results** on this due to the software or the individual games level of optimisation.

The **reliability of its tracking** is a major issue that **Windows Mixed Reality developers** need to focus on. Since the headset only sees the controllers in front and not the back, sometimes the controllers' virtual representation smack you on the face when it's behind the headset or underneath when it **loses track** of them.

It's a **bad user experience** as it's really distracting for the user. Some games like **SPARC by CCP** need accurate tracking and become almost unplayable due to **network lag** and **subpar tracking** over a complete range of motion.

‍

![SPARC by CCP](/blog/images/6130be440c5bdb436a329bbf_20180203200917_1_vr-1024x458.jpeg)

SPARC by CCP, the tracking lag caused the ball to be suspended in mid-air for a moment, resulted in a trajectory that’s completely different than expected.

‍

This is where **HTC Vive's outside-in tracking** wins. By use of its **base stations** it tracks the controllers and the headset in the space, independent from each other.

I'm hoping that in the future, Microsoft will update their range of Mixed Reality headsets with the help of the **PC's webcam** to track the controllers behind the headset and let the player face away from the PC.

Escape Room by OneTechAsia on steam has no option to calibrate the floor. Once you’ve dropped an item It’s very hard to pick it back up.

‍

## Summary

This is the **first generation** of Windows Mixed Reality headsets and they need to **impress the market**. The Odyssey impressed me from **hardware quality**, however it needs to improve on the **user experience** quickly, by updating its software to fix **controllers tracking issues** and its WMR system's **compatibility** with different games or apps.

If it doesn't it will just be forgotten as the market will prefer something that is more expensive but has **better compatibility** with current games or apps and **better room scale tracking**.

### The Good

-   **Beautiful screens** - Games, videos and apps just looks great, it's **immersive** and the **pixels disappeared**.
-   **Consumer ready at the price range** - This is a great VR headset for **mass adoption**, less complicated to setup.
-   **It's comfy** - The headset is **comfortable** and the controllers are **ergonomically designed**.

### The Bad

-   **Tracking is a bit off at times** - Microsoft really need to up their game on this one through **software updates** or new features. It's one of the **biggest selling point** of the headset other than its screen.
-   **Early Days Compatibility issues** - Most games and apps are designed for **HTC Vive** or **Oculus Rift**. So not all of them are compatible with the Odyssey.
-   **Limited availability** - The odyssey isn't available via retail in Australia yet.

If you have the same headset let me know what you think about it, your experience with it and if it meets your expectations.
