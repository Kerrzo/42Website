Hi **coders,** I will share how to create a simple e-commerce mobile app using the **Flutter** framework and **GetX** state management library with **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural patterns in this article. By the end of this article, you’ll not only have a functional e-commerce app but also a deeper understanding of how to structure and manage your Flutter projects for scalability and maintainability.

‍

## **What is Flutter/GetX Flutter Library/Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern?**

‍

**Flutter** is an open-source framework developed by Google for building natively compiled mobile, web, and desktop applications from a single codebase. It is primarily used for creating user interfaces (UIs) and is particularly popular for mobile app development.

‍

**GetX** is a popular state management and navigation library for Flutter. GetX is designed to simplify and streamline the development process by offering a set of tools and utilities that make it easier to manage application state, handle navigation, and perform other common tasks in Flutter app development.

‍

**Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** is a software architectural pattern used to develop user interfaces, particularly in the context of software applications. MVVM is often associated with frameworks and technologies for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation), :, and others. It aims to separate the concerns of an application’s user interface into three distinct components which are **Model, View,** and **ViewModel**.

‍

**App Features**

-   Display list products.
-   Display list products by category.
-   Display product detail.
-   Add product to Cart by quantity.
-   Remove product from Cart.

‍

## The Goals

‍

-   Implementing GetX state management and GetX route in the app.

-   Implementing MVVM pattern by data model (model), screen (view), and controller & binding (view-model).
-   Separate screen widgets into reusable components.
-   Implement the app features.

‍

## **The Good Things**

‍

-   Flutter Widgets system gives more flexibility, able to combine multiple widgets.
-   GetX is simple, and its state & navigation management is easy to use. They have multiple ways to render the data into the view.
-   A lot of Flutter packages are available and have good documentation. Useful website for Flutter package detailing ➝ [https://fluttergems.dev/](https://fluttergems.dev/).
-   With GetX, we can initialise multiple controllers. With this feature, we can define a global controller and screen controller and then use them for our purpose.

‍

## The Challenges

‍

-   When dealing with API requests, it's essential to establish the model according to the API response. Initially, I manually crafted the model, but later discovered helpful tools like [https://javiercbk.github.io/json\_to\_dart/](https://javiercbk.github.io/json_to_dart/) to convert JSON responses into models, saving me valuable time.
-   Occasionally, when relocating widgets, I find myself copying and pasting code, leading to errors when I forget to include the closing bracket.

‍

## **Steps**

‍

Let's start by outlining the step-by-step process of building a basic e-commerce Mobile App using Flutter & GetX with the MVVM Pattern.

‍

#### **Create Flutter Project**

Run the flutter create command: **_flutter create simple\_ecommerce_**

‍

If you encounter a "command not found" error, please consult this solution for resolution: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/50653621.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50653621)

‍

Alternatively, you can create a Flutter project from Visual Studio Code by following this guide: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=vscode.](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/test-drive?tab=vscode)

‍

Upon successful creation, the project structure will resemble the following:

‍

#### **Install GetX Flutter Package**

[https://pub.dev/packages/get](https://pub.dev/packages/get)

**_flutter pub add get_**

‍

#### **Update Project Structure**

Here is project structure that we will use in this app:

## Summary

‍

This tutorial walks you through creating a straightforward e-commerce mobile app using Flutter framework and GetX state [management](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) library following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. Key features of the app include product display, category filtering, product detail viewing, and cart management (adding/removing products). Objectives encompass incorporating GetX state management and routing, implementing MVVM pattern, modularising screen widgets into reusable components, and realising essential app functionalities. The tutorial underscores benefits like Flutter widget flexibility, GetX simplicity, Flutter package availability, and controller setup ease. Challenges discussed entail defining models for API requests and handling widget placement errors.
