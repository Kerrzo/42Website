**CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE**

Coronavirus began infecting many people around the world at the end of 2019. Many industries were impacted as a result of this global pandemic, for example, businesses that rely on physical visits would suffer greatly. 42 Interactive and PROPVIZ collaborated with Catholic Healthcare Croydon Retirement Village to create 3D scans of the spaces so that people could explore them virtually even if they couldn't freely explore the physical location. It has addressed the issue that had been discouraging people from visiting the location.

**TUMBALONG LIGHTS – VIVID 2019**

42 Interactive was privileged to collaborate with Digby Webster for Tumbalong Lights Vivid 2019. In this event, 42 Interactive makes Digby Webster’s artwork come to life by making the art following people's facial expressions & body tracking. Face and body tracking would be the best way to make it work in an environment where everyone can participate. To accomplish this, we designed a large interactive screen with a detached tracking camera and computer box in front of it, using Microsoft Kinect V2.0 as the tracking camera, and utilising its face tracking feature to control Digby artwork.

**NEUROTECHNOLOGY - TRANCEDUCER AND COGNITI VR**

The Tranceducer is a virtual mirror box that allows the subject to experience their virtual body as a “real body” that they inhabit and see in a mirror. VR embodiment implies that the person is unable to distinguish between the virtual body and their own body. Changes in the brain's experience and activity result from therapeutic intervention in the virtual environment. CognitiVR takes everything we know about pain and its treatment and tailors the VR experience to maximise therapeutic benefit. CognitiVR is a treatment that interacts with clients in a VR environment to create lasting learning and change in neuroplasticity.

**NEUROTECHNOLOGY - INSTACALM VR**

Instacalm VR is a relaxation and meditation training package experience in [virtual reality](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/drug-free-and-surgery-free-chronic-pain-management) space which designed by our Clinical Psychologist. Using VR to assist in a Rapid relaxation training experience. Each module uses a VR environment to teach and extend meditation skills to maximise experience and learning.
