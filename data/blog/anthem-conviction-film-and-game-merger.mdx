## Neill Blomkamp has just released the short Anthem Conviction

With early access to BioWare's new team shooter, Anthem Conviction is starting on the 15th (in the US), it is very interesting to see the last marketing attempt before release to come in the form of a short directed movie.

Neill Blomkamp (District 9, Chappie) from [Oats Studios](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD4ZEYIBnHIC2DUhiizMOHg) has just released the short Anthem Conviction. It is a prequel to the games universe by utilising a combination of live assets and reusing game assets and some in game footage.

It is great to see Blomkamp championing traditional live action with modern real-time techniques. And it is only available through the utilisation of game engines. With the release of the RTX "10 gigarays" GPUs by NVIDIA, the visual difference between CGI and live file is only getting closer and closer.

We are looking forward to playing Anthem and seeing if the story is up to BioWare's standard. And also for the next Film/Game merge by Blomkamp. See you in Fort Tarsis.
