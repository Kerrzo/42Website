Easter is coming. All around the world celebrate it, but this year will be a little bit different. Below you will find some ideas, and cool - fun (AND FREE!) apps to have the tradition keeps going with friends, family or even by yourself at home.

The quarantine does not have to give us a hard time to enjoy Easter holiday like before. We just have to do it slightly different by being creative. Here is how:

## **Change the way you dye eggs**‍

For many families, dyeing Easter eggs together is an annual tradition. This year, though, fresh eggs may be hard to find on grocery store shelves. Also, if you do have fresh eggs at home, you want to preserve them for eating, not decorating or crafting. Consider using Styrofoam eggs or another type of crafting egg. Or you can find an app safe and fun for your kids to paint Easter eggs online. Here is one: [3D Easter Egg Painter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-3d-easter-egg-painter/id361405258).

## **Do an alternative egg hunt**‍

Setting the kids loose on a field or playground dotted with eggs isn’t really social distancing. Instead, if your home and yard have the space, tuck eggs around your house for your kids to find. For a larger egg hunt, get in touch with your neighborhood group text or homeowners’ association.

Ask all participating families to decorate large Easter eggs on paper and then tape the paper eggs into windows facing the street. On Easter Sunday, families can head out careful to keep their distance from one another to try and spot all the eggs in the neighborhood. Or you can host a Virtual Easter egg hunt. [Martha Stewart will tell you how](https://www.marthastewart.com/7753382/host-virtual-easter-egg-hunt).

## **Rethink Easter baskets and gifts**‍

Consider tucking homemade sweets into baskets or fill them with print-outs or drawings of the Easter gifts you plan to order or buy once businesses are open again. If you can, for Easter gifts for kids, focus on digital gifts you can enjoy in the moment.

Buy and download a new movie or new game for them to enjoy at home. And with [TouchNote](https://touchnote.com/us/), you can send personalised Easter Cards to all of your friends and family around the world. It is available in both Google Play and Apple Store.

## **Order in for your Easter dinner**‍

You want your groceries to last as long as possible, and taking a trip to the grocery store just to pick up extra eggs and potatoes for your Easter spread isn’t worth the risk.

Instead, consider supporting local businesses. Call around to see if any restaurants are offering a to-go or delivery special for Easter meals. Place your order a few days in advance so the restaurant is prepared and get ready to enjoy your meal stress-free.

## **Focus on small-scale Easter games**‍

Focus on games—beyond the egg hunt—your family can play together, such as guess the number of jelly beans or Easter egg basketball, even if you only have one or two kids in the family. For older kids, consider giving your favorite family games an Easter spin: Play Scrabble with all Easter- or spring-themed words, for example. Here is [10 best Easter games app](https://www.mykidstime.com/entertainment/10-best-apps-for-kids-easter/).

## **Adjust your expectations for your Easter service**‍

If your Easter celebration includes a religious component, think carefully about attending church services. Many states, counties, and cities have banned all group gatherings. Even if your church does still hold a service, consider if attending worth the risk for you and your family (and others attending).

Check with your church on Easter to see if it’s hosting a digital service: Many religious organisations have been offering online services. Also, there are many apps of [Online Bible app to read, listen and watch daily verses.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sirma.mobile.bible.android&hl=en_AU)
