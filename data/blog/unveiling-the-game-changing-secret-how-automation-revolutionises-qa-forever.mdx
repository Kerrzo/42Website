## Best Practices for Automation in QA

‍

Answering the question "What is the best practice for automation in QA?" does not have a definitive answer since the approach to automated testing depends on specific needs and urgency. Automating all tests is impractical, if not impossible. Nonetheless, we can provide some recommendations to enhance your automated testing strategy:

‍

### Planning automated testing early

‍

Automated testing necessitates acquiring resources such as machines and software, which may become a bottleneck due to the time and resource allocation it requires. Consequently, it is recommended to plan ahead to avoid complications that may result from exceeding your costs and schedules.

‍

Test cases that are ideal for automation are those that are repetitive, time-consuming, and involve a significant amount of manual effort, as well as tasks that are susceptible to human error. It is essential to meticulously identify the appropriate test cases for automation.

‍

### Selecting the appropriate automation test approach and tools

‍

Numerous automation tools are available in the market. It is crucial to choose the appropriate approach and then select a suitable automation tool for developing an automation test case that is robust and maintainable. It is also essential to have a well-defined process for the roll-out of test automation. Do not be easily swayed by the "best" automation testing tool in the industry. We highly recommend using the most robust tools that are adaptable to most, if not all, languages, platforms, and operating systems.

‍

### Establishing the automation test environment

‍

Thoroughly assess the testing environment and procure the necessary automation tools for the automation test. While testing development can be unpredictable, establishing a stable and reliable testing environment is vital for the successful execution of automated tests.

‍

Moreover, adopting continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices can greatly benefit the automation process. CI and CD facilitate the automation of the build and deployment process, ensuring rapid and efficient testing and deployment of code.

‍

### Designing the automation test

‍

Once the automation strategy, tool, and environment are finalised, the next step is to design the test scripts. It is crucial to work in parallel with software development to keep up with any application changes. The QA team should collaborate closely with the development team to design the automation test and ensure that the automation framework integrates seamlessly with the development and deployment pipelines.

### Testing early and frequently

‍

Perform tests as frequently as necessary to promptly identify and report bugs as they arise. This practice enables the QA team to take immediate action, saving valuable time and resources that would otherwise be required to address these issues in later stages of development or even in production.

‍

### Regularly conducting reviews

‍

Regular review of the automated test results is crucial to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement. Analysing the test outcomes can help in expanding the test coverage and validating the reports and documentation from previous runs. It is essential to report the test results regularly to the stakeholders to keep them updated on the project's status. This helps in maintaining transparency and communication within the team and ensures that everyone is on the same page.

‍

## Challenges of Automation in QA

‍

In today's agile software development environments, an efficient test automation system is crucial. Automation is particularly effective for smoke and regression tests, enabling QA teams to create and execute complex test cases easily. It also empowers developers to conduct more frequent tests on their software, resulting in quicker feedback and early detection of bugs and issues.

‍

However, there are also challenges associated with test automation. One challenge is the high initial investment required in terms of time, money, and resources, which can be especially difficult for small and medium-sized businesses with limited budgets.

‍

Another common challenge is network disconnection, which can hinder access to databases, VPNs, third-party services, APIs, and specific testing environments. Unstable network connections can lead to delays and disrupt the testing process.

‍

Lack of coding skills can pose problems for QA teams when working with test scripts. To address this, teams can leverage reusability and treat test code as production code to maintain their scripts more effectively.

‍

Maintenance of automation scripts is an ongoing process. Regular updates are necessary to ensure their effectiveness and relevance. However, this can be challenging if the team lacks the required technical expertise and resources.

‍

Resistance to automation implementation can arise from team members who fear job loss or changes to their work processes. Overcoming this resistance requires a shift in mindset and culture within the organisation.
