## **Everyone Can Play**

We’re inspired by [Everyone Can Play](https://everyonecanplay.nsw.gov.au/) initiative to look at how playgrounds can be as inclusive as possible.

Everyone Can Play is a best practice resource for councils, community leaders, landscape architects and passionate local residents. It is a reference guide for creating world-class play spaces, designed to include everyone in the community. At the heart of Everyone Can Play is the declaration that play is for everyone – regardless of age, ability or cultural background.

Find My Playground have implemented some of their brilliant methodologies. You can find this in the list of features foreach playground. The inclusive features for people with disabilities are listed at the top, which not many sites or playground search engines do.

## **Our Goal**

We hope Find My Playground can help all families to find a playground that is inclusive and increase awareness for our community leaders and government to create more accessible and inclusive public facilities.

Children who play outdoors improve their motor skills, body mass index, overall health and muscle strength. Spending active time outdoors as a kid is also important for life-long health. Children that are active in their early years generally continue to be more active as they age. Encouraging outdoor play in young children helps develop a healthy attitude about maintaining an active adult lifestyle.
