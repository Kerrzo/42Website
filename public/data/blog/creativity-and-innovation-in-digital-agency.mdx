## Creativity

When creativity is mentioned, most people think of something related to design. But creativity is not limited only to the design, it is also expressed in creative thinking.

[Creative](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy) thinking can be a powerful tool in marketing and business in general. Creativity has been fundamental to marketing success long before the internet came about. It has always been a key factor in standing out, as well as in traditional marketing.

Many marketers prefer to focus on existing methods and techniques rather than developing fresh new ideas, which is crucial for the success of the digital marketing strategy today. In digital marketing, doing things differently is essential to remaining competitive. This involves the ability to solve problems with a new approach and imagine the possibilities where others see the impossible.

Creativity plays a vital role in helping companies manage tasks, improve staff performance, and create quality products in the digital industry.

Creativity is also essential to building a fun and aspirational company image. With partners and consumers seeing the company's work culture this can provide further positivity to the organisations and associations involved.

With creative thinking, innovation develops.

## Innovation

Innovation is the result of creativity that is implemented to produce a business impact that is very difficult for competitors to imitate.

The result of innovation is what differentiates the company from other competitors. Innovative products will have a unique attraction to potential consumers.

Creativity goes hand in hand with innovation. There is no innovation without creativity. While creativity is the ability to produce new and unique ideas, innovation is the implementation of that creativity – that’s the introduction of a new idea, solution, process, or product. Creativity is the driving force behind innovation and the incorporation of looking at things from a different perspective and free from restrictions of rules and written or unwritten "usual" procedures or flows.

## Creativity and Innovation is Important

Creativity and innovation within a well-run digital agency have always been recognised as a sure path to success. Stimulating creativity and exploring completely new and unknown territories leads to the formation of new fresh perspectives and ideas.

Once your business brain is able to think outside the box, the possibilities are endless.
