## CRM Benefits

### Facilitate upselling and cross-selling to customers

It is significantly easier to sell to an existing customer than it is to acquire new ones. Your CRM can assist you in accomplishing this by swiftly retrieving information about a customer's most recent purchase, any critical account information, and any specific issues they're seeking assistance with.

You can then employ a consultative sales technique, offering suggestions and solutions to any pertinent difficulties. This can also aid in the [development](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) of trust and rapport with prospects.

### Establish a centralised source of truth within your business

How frequently do you find yourself checking your inbox, Teams, Slack, a Google Doc, and various spreadsheets for updates on a given deal?

With a CRM system, there is just one spot to look up customer information, track the status of a particular contract, or check sales data. This increases your team's collaboration and efficiency, while also reducing information/knowledge silos.

### Keep track on offers

You may track the complete customer path in your CRM, from initial contact and sales conversations to sales quotes, customer support emails, and repeat purchases. This is applicable to both individual deals and obtaining a bird's-eye perspective of your complete sales pipeline at any given time.

### Maintain relationships with customers

When your sales, marketing, and support teams all use the same CRM, managing customer interactions becomes much easier. You can view a customer's most recent purchase, if they viewed a certain marketing communication, and any recent support concerns.

### Personality lead

Simply entering your sales funnel does not indicate that a visitor is ready to buy. This is why it's beneficial to have a sales [strategy](https://www.42interactive.com/) in place to educate prospects. This is typically accomplished through a combination of tailored emails, phone calls, and email drip campaigns. Not only can a CRM automate drip mailings, but it can also ensure that no prospects fall between the cracks.

### Analyse comprehensive reports and anticipate future sales

All of these are queries that may be answered within your CRM. Additionally, you can use past data to perform sales forecasting, which can assist you in setting sales objectives and anticipating hiring and operational needs.
