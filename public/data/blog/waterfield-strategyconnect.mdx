**How we balance between developing and executing a strategy, while connecting a team in the process to own and action it.**

‍

Finding the balance between strategy [development](https://www.42interactive.com/) and execution can be challenging, especially when it comes to engaging and mobilising your team. However, successful leaders understand the importance of creating a shared vision that everyone feels connected to and empowered by.

‍

The key is to involve your team in both the planning and implementation stages so they feel invested in the strategy's success. Building trust and open communication within your team will help ensure that everyone understands their role in making this strategy a reality while maintaining focus on achieving goals through collective action. In summary, effective leadership requires striking a balance between developing a sound strategy while fostering teamwork that collectively owns its implementation from inception to delivery with measurable progress checkpoints along the way towards ultimate success!

The main objective of this project is to restructure the AWS solution in accordance with AWS best practices, ensuring that our client application leverages all available AWS features while maintaining a high level of security. Our team has also implemented front-end updates, including a secure deployment incorporating WOLK updates based on the latest AWS architecture standards and security guidelines.Additionally, we have successfully migrated the database to the Amazon RDS environment for [improved](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy) scalability and performance. To streamline development processes and ensure efficient delivery of changes, we have converted the older CI/CD version to a more current Bitbucket CI/CD pipeline.
