**QA as a Service** can be implemented as desired, to perform **testing** throughout the software [development](https://www.42interactive.com/) lifecycle, only to test specific **prototypes**, or simply as **monitoring** to see the performance of a client application, or even to test certain much larger features.

You should project **QA testing** with the required amount of resources. This, in turn, allows testing to be carried out to the extent or detail required, at a cost tailored to those specific needs.

## **Why Does a Company Need QA Testing and What are the Common Use Cases for QA as a Service?**

Every market is based on meeting **customer needs** and of course **software development companies** always have the option of developing their own **test infrastructure**, but there are many circumstances in which organisations can gain a **real business advantage** by **outsourcing the software testing processes**.

## **What Does QA as a Service Do?**

What Software development companies gain if they use QA as a Service?

### **_Additional Skills_**‍

For some **Software development companies** or **software development teams**, team members may not have the necessary expertise for **Software Quality Assurance** specific skills. It makes sense to **outsource the testing process** when it is clear that the expertise of the **external service provider** will improve **project outcomes**.

### **_Better Way to Testing_**‍

For **development teams** pursuing **continuous integration** or **continuous delivery** work models and embracing **Agile and DevOps practices**, the need for **frequent testing** can overwhelm developers, especially those who provide the most value by building new code.

When applications are too complex for the **traditional manual testing model**, a **QA as a Service provider** can help run **automated tests** with short turnarounds and free up developer time to keep pushing new code. And more resources to help the development process.

### **_Streamlined Infrastructure_**‍

**Software development companies** can incur significant **up front costs** when building their own **test infrastructure**. These costs cover things like **hardware testing**, **software licensing**, and the actual time it takes to design and code the **test scripts**.

Due to **resource constraints**, it is often more effective and efficient to hire a **third-party QA service provider** who already has the necessary infrastructure to perform the desired tests. But there is a downside, the 3rd party takes a long time because they have to learn the project itself. But with more resources these cons could have minimal impact.

Perhaps best for the **QA team**, **component QA as a Service** means that the **testing process** is flexible enough to **scale as necessary**, from week to week or from component to component, as **project demands** change.

## **What Types of Testing is Outsourced to QA as a Service?**

**QA as a Service** is flexible and can provide a very broad set of **test capabilities**. A company running **QA as a Service** typically uses a large number of individuals involved in the **crowdsourced nature** of QA as a Service platform, from multiple locales, and using **real world tools**. But there are some companies that run QA as a Service as part of their services.

**Software development companies** may choose to **outsource** various types of **functional and non-functional testing activities** to a **QA as a Service** provider. Some of the highlights are:

### **_Automatic Regression Testing (ART)_**‍

**Automatic regression testing** is usually performed after a new **software update** is released. New releases will be run through **automated unit batteries** and **integration tests** to verify that code compiles correctly after a new update.

**ART** goes through a series of tests that include all **critical functional tests** for the app or website, as well as testing for **external services** that support the app or digital platform.

### **_Mobile Testing_**‍

Consumers are increasingly accessing your apps and websites via **mobile**, increasing the importance of delivering **seamless, high-quality app performance** across devices, operating systems and web browsers.

**Mobile testing services** can help your team **optimise your app's performance** across platforms and ensure that it can manage the **anticipated volume of mobile connections**.

### **_Server Load & Performance Testing_**‍

**Performance testing** [services](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy) include the analysis of **user scenarios** and **transactions** in a **simulated production environment**. 

**Testing-as-a-Service providers** can run simulations with a predetermined number of transactions, users, and views to assess the **performance of your application** under different **server loads** and **stress conditions**.
