On the night of 11th July 2021, the 42Interactive team lost one of the most amazing humans we have ever worked with.

The world has lost a soul that touched everyone she met with compassion, kindness and humour.

A one-off and always striving to improve her teammates and the business ahead of herself.

As a team, we are all grateful to have known her personally and have had the opportunity to work closely with her.  

The 42Interactive business has grown over the last few years and will continue to do so, with great people and culture,  and this initial foundation and continued success has a lot to do with her input and involvement with people on all levels.

Like so many she knew and worked with before the 42 Interactive team will miss her greatly.

Sleep well Mariza  xx
