With the world increasingly moving digital, it's become essential for businesses to digitise in order to stay afloat. Tasks that used to take hours can now be completed rapidly with the help of automation - meaning businesses can save time and money while still getting the job done efficiently.

‍

Digital transformation is a process that can often take months or even years for organisations to complete, due to the many complicated factors. However, with the continuous advancement of technology, businesses can now complete the shift in a matter of weeks or even days. As [technology](https://www.42interactive.com/) keeps changing at a fast pace, businesses must adopt new methods and processes to remain relevant. Sometimes, such change must be made quickly so that the business does not miss out on the benefits. This is the acceleration aspect of digital transformation.

## What is Digital Acceleration in Digital Transformation?

‍

Digital acceleration is a key part of any digital [transformation](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) journey. Over the past few years, many organisations have been slowly changing the way they operate but when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, it was clear that these businesses needed to speed up their transformation in order to survive. By accelerating their digital transformation, these organisations were able to adapt quickly to the new landscape and continue serving their customers in a meaningful way.

‍

Businesses have always needed to be flexible in order to succeed, but this became even more apparent during the pandemic as organisations scrambled to adjust their business models to accommodate remote working and contactless delivery methods. Many businesses struggled with making this change and found themselves needing to streamline workflows to make data more accessible for their workforce. This gave birth to the age of ‘Digital Acceleration’ and the adoption of digitised process management.

‍

Before the global pandemic, many companies' focus was limited to digital transformation. Digital transformation, as most businesses know it, involves transforming one digital process at a time as they have the time, the capital, or a high enough ROI to do so. Digital acceleration is a business strategy that guides the company's future. The focus shifted from digitising a process to adopting the latest technologies. The bitter truth from this, is that there is no standard for digital acceleration roadmap or strategy for companies to follow.

‍

No two organisations are the same, each with their own specific needs that may require different approaches when it comes to change and technology. The best way to accelerate digital transformation efforts is by working with all members of your organisation to create a digital strategy that works for everyone. This way, you can be sure that you're taking the safest route possible while still making progress.

‍

Digital acceleration and digital transformation are not the same thing, even though they both share the common goal of using technology to reshape workflows and keep up with the evolving demands of consumers. However, there are significant differences that can help define digital acceleration more accurately:

‍

-   The digital acceleration phase has caused the rate of technology adoption to increase at a much faster rate.
-   Digital transformation is an ongoing process that occurs when an organisation adapts its business model and processes to take advantage of digital technologies.
-   When digital transformation is taking place, an acceleration of strategy may be employed if there is pressure from competitors or demand from users to prioritise speed. This means that every project is given a sense of urgency so that it can be completed as quickly as possible.
-   The digital transformation is a process that requires companies to employ an accelerated strategy in order to keep up with the competition and the demands of users. This means that every project must be completed quickly and efficiently in order to maintain a high level of quality.

## How the Pandemic Fuelled Enterprise Digital Transformation

‍

Before the pandemic, both private and public organisations were transitioning to digital business models, but that journey is going at varying speeds. The pandemic has forced a dramatic acceleration of the speed of change and investment in digital transformation.

‍

The digital transformation that was once limited to cloud transformation has now become a major factor in influencing business outcomes. With the outbreak of the pandemic, consumers have rapidly moved towards online channels and businesses have responded in turn. organisations are now building ecosystems that enable growth, innovation and improved user experience under these new conditions.

‍

Many organisations are now focusing on providing digital human experiences through the use of AI and other digital technologies. This can include using AI to analyse customer data and create personalised services for specific segments of users, as well as using digital assistants and other tools to provide more human-like interactions with customers and employees. Additionally, many organisations are partnering with service providers to gain access to advanced AI and other technologies to improve these digital human experiences.

#### **Accelerating Digital Transformation**

‍

The global pandemic has accelerated the pace of digital transformation for many organisations, as consumers have shifted to online and digital channels for shopping, communication, and other activities. Businesses that were able to quickly adapt to these changes and offer digital solutions have been better positioned to meet the needs of consumers and maintain their market position. Digital transformation can also help organisations improve their operational efficiency, reduce costs, and gain a competitive advantage. However, it's important to keep in mind that digital transformation is an ongoing process and not a one-time event. Organisations must be prepared to continuously update and improve their digital capabilities in order to stay relevant in today's fast-paced business environment.

#### Areas to Accelerate Digital Transformation

‍

The four areas that are commonly identified as important in a digital transformation are:

-   Customer Experience (CX)
-   Data & Analytics
-   Cloud Computing
-   Mobility

‍

In order to succeed, it's not simply a matter of hiring those who are expert in using digital technology, but everyone in the organisation must change their mindset and undergo training that could enable them to work together as a team. Additionally, a business must really understand its users and collect customer data continuously to determine which products or services best meet their needs.

‍

Finally, organisations must be willing to adapt to mobility in order to stay competitive in today's business environment. As more and more employees use smartphones and tablets to access information, organisations must ensure that their digital systems and processes are mobile-friendly and accessible from a variety of devices.

#### Three Tactics to Accelerate a Digital Transformation

-   Actively shape day-to-day behaviour and remove the need for a physical signature. Applications, forms and agreements can now be signed digitally, making it more convenient for everyone involved.
-   Systematically reinforce desired behaviour changes, it is important to have a plan and be consistent with using these productivity-boosting strategies.Productivity can be enhanced by incorporating digital tools and technology into your work routine. The latest technology also allows people to work remotely from anywhere in the world.
