The key to adopting video into your SEO [strategy](https://www.42interactive.com/) is to put in the effort necessary to create high-quality content that is targeted towards a certain objective. After all, video is not always the helper of your website.

Consider it in terms of a cycle. Video improves your position, which results in more people seeing your website, which results in more people clicking on your link. However, they will leave your site quickly if your on-page material is not of good quality.

Indeed, this could be harmful. Hosting a low-quality video with little or no context will result in a drop in rank, as the search engine does not want to direct users to an useless page. While more people may initially notice your site in the SERPs, if your page does not suit their intent, they will shortly exit.

This will boost your bounce rate (a statistic we previously identified as one that Google values for SEO), signaling to Google that your page is irrelevant. What is the end result? You'll lose the ranking you just got, and you may lose more ranks as a result of your site's lack of authority in Google's eyes.

None of this is a problem if you devote sufficient time and care to developing your strategy. With the following critical guidelines, you can begin ranking on SERPs.

## Include Video Content on Your Website

Creating videos is insufficient—you must to upload them on your site. Simply ensure that the placement is logical. A brand video fits perfectly on your website's "About Us" page or on your homepage. A product video is an excellent addition to your e-commerce platform or to the product descriptions on your website.

Testimonial videos are particularly effective and may be used almost anyplace on your site. One additional tip—while you're releasing video content for SEO purposes, you can reuse it in other ways to enhance the rest of your [marketing](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy) campaign.

## Provide Context For Your Video

Publishing your video on a page that is otherwise blank will accomplish little. Ensure that your video is included where it makes sense and is surrounded by other pertinent written and visual information. Additionally, you may provide a transcript of your movie to target additional keywords and convert any visual graphics to a downloadable JPEG. The more Google comprehends how your video fits into the on-page material, the more accurate your results will be.

## Ensure that Your Video is Educational

If a prospective customer has questions about your brand, services, goods, or industry, responding to these inquiries will educate and empower them as they make their purchasing decision. If you consistently respond to their questions, you develop authority and trust as a result of the value you provide. As a result, the search engines begin to boost your pages even more. For your product pages, consider including a Q&A video or a demonstration of your products in action. Additionally, you can employ video on instructional pages such as your blog to provide an alternative to lengthy text.

## Maintain Consistency

You cannot go to the gym once and expect to walk away with six-pack abs. Likewise, with video marketing! Consistency and commitment are critical. Strive to continually deliver value and to rank for a variety of relevant keywords that fit your consumers' search intent. The good news is that once you see how well it works, you'll be driven to create more material!

## Don't Overlook the Technical Specifics

Simply uploading your film to a site such as [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) or Vimeo is the first step. Remember to enter the appropriate information on the backend so that search engine crawlers can properly identify and priorities your video.

YouTube ranks users based on a variety of factors:

-   Information about the title tag
-   Retention of the audience
-   Keywords within the description tag
-   Duration of the video
-   Subscribers gained as a result of watching Comments Likes and dislikes

While not all of them are totally within your control (comments and subscribers, for example), focus on the ones that are to ensure you've done everything possible to help your video rank.

There are an increasing amount of queries that include some form of video material. The positions that videos take up in those results are essentially unavailable for conventional web pages. This presents an excellent opportunity for you, as you can fight for those SERPs in two distinct ways: through your standard web pages and through your videos.

However, it's important to understand that Google is significantly more likely to rank YouTube videos. If you want your videos to appear in Google search, the best option is to put them on YouTube.

YouTube is a massive search engine in itself. You may generate large traffic to your videos through YouTube searches, and while this traffic is directed to the video itself rather than your website, it still provides great branding potential.

Google and YouTube, on the other hand, rate videos differently. YouTube does use the metadata (title, description, and categories) you input for the video to determine its relevancy and then ranks it based on view time-related metrics.

YouTube examines the entire amount of time spent on the site. It makes no difference whether or not all of the videos viewed are from your account. If someone starts with your video and then moves on to other channels, this still benefits you.

Google ranks videos using a far more traditional set of algorithms. The metadata you give here is still relevant, but so are links to the video. To achieve a high ranking in both search engines, you must:

-   Create fascinating films that people will want to watch (preferably all the way through) and will want to connect to.
-   Create videos that pique people's interest in video.
-   Utilize playlists that individuals choose to employ to direct their viewing. Include videos from other channels in your playlist.
-   Include the video on your own website by embedding it.
-   Encourage others to embed your films to increase their exposure.
-   Consider paid marketing to increase the amount of time viewers spend watching your video.
-   Promote the video across numerous channels to increase viewership and possibly generate links to the videos.
-   And, of course, be extremely conscientious about how you implement metadata for your videos!

## Final Thought

Users will leave your site if they see poor quality video content with little or no context. If you want your video to appear in Google search, the best option is to put it on YouTube.

YouTube ranks users based on a variety of factors, including the title tag and keywords within the description tag. The good news is that once you see how well it works, you'll be driven to create more material! Google and YouTube rate videos by the amount of time spent on their respective sites.

To achieve a high ranking in both, you must create videos that pique people's interest. Google ranks videos using a far more traditional set of algorithms; YouTube uses metadata to determine relevancy.
