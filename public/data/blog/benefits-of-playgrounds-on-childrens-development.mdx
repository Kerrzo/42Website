## 

With technology becoming more and more commonplace in our society, children are overwhelmed with excessive use of smartphones, tablets, and video games leaving less time for outdoor play. This lack of free play can have negative consequences for their development.

‍

Playgrounds provide children with opportunities to explore, receive, learn and practice key [developmental](https://www.42interactive.com/) skills in a safe environment. Playgrounds allow children to express themselves freely and have fun while they develop important physical, social, cognitive and emotional skills.

‍

Parents need to understand how crucial time at the playgrounds is for children development. Playgrounds provide opportunities for children to explore and use their imagination, which helps them develop important motor skills. In fact, playgrounds represent one of the most important parts of children’s early development.

‍

_The University of Minnesota Institute of Child Development examines the link between play and brain development, motor-sill, and social capabilities. What’s been discovered is that emotional, social motor, and cognitive learning is enhanced and accelerated by play._

Playground playtime can significantly enhance children’s motor skills development and boost their sense of coordination. Children learn valuable lessons on playgrounds, their abilities to think fast is significantly developed when they have no idea what will be coming next, children tend to work hard to improve their physical development without them even realising it and playground environment allow children to learn to develop their social skills and learn to figure out how to put themselves in many situations with their peers. Children tend to be more adventurous at a playground, and they will unconsciously force themselves to do many things they want to do in order to join the fun.

‍

A playground is an important place for children to learn how to interact with other kids, and it also helps them understand boundaries. They will learn how to use both verbal and non-verbal communication in order to participate in activities or play. On the playground, children will learn essential social skills such as how to introduce themselves to new people, compromise, set boundaries, and solve problems. These skills will play a crucial role in their future and help them establish interpersonal relationships.

Playgrounds are often occupied by children of varying ages, which means that some of the older children will likely have more advanced communication skills compared to the younger ones. In order for the younger ones to be able to participate and benefit from the activities on the playground, they will have to learn to communicate at many different levels. Although the benefits of this enhanced development will not be immediately seen, they will become evident over time as children grow and have to face a wide variety of people - especially in a work environment.

## What is Play

‍

Outdoor play is not only beneficial for children's development, but as they grow older, it becomes increasingly important for parents to encourage their kids to find time for outdoor activities. This can be exploring parks and local playgrounds - anything to get them enjoying the great outdoors! Playing is a natural and fun way for children to keep themselves active, well, and happy - it helps with their healthy development across the board. Children need various unstructured play opportunities from birth until the age of teenagers in order to maintain good physical and mental health, as well as learning important life skills.

‍

Play is essential for children's mental, physical and social development. Through play, they learn more about the world and themselves. Play allows children to be creative while developing their imagination, emotional strength, cognitive skills, and dexterity. It also offers an ideal opportunity for parents to fully engage with their loved ones. Through play, children at an early age can explore the world around them and find ways to interact with it on their own terms. This playtime allows them to develop new skills and confidence that they can use to face future challenges. In group play, children will learn how to work well with others, how to share and compromise, how to solve problems, and how to be self-advocates. All of these skills will be vital as they continue to grow and develop.

‍

Play is essential for all children for their physical and social development stage, but unfortunately, not every child is fortunate enough to have enough time to do so. Many children are being raised in an increasingly pressured style that most probably will limit the benefits they would gain from child-driven play. Every child deserves the play opportunity in order to develop their very own unique potential. And parents need to consider all factors that will potentially interfere with children's optimal development and allow their little ones to fully reap the advantages associated with play.

‍

Freely chosen play, also known as child-driven play, is when children decide and control their play according to their own choice, [imagination](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy), and interest without being led by adults. Although parents still need to supervise the activity, freely chosen play helps improves children’s well-being and development.

‍

Children often want to create some challenges in their play, they will unconsciously test themselves to find out their own limits, they will learn how to deal with risk through play and learn how to compromise and problem-solve in a good manner. Freely chosen play is a great way for children to explore their interests, try new things, and develop important life skills.

‍

Child-driven play is so important because it allows children to explore their own interests, learn how to make decisions, and move at their own pace. When parents are involved in their children's play, they get to see the world from their child's perspective, which then helps improve communication and understanding between parents and their children. Children who are not very talkative may be able to express themselves more easily and parent's can gain a better understanding of their experiences, views and even frustration during play. Parent's should take advantage of this opportunity to fully engage with their children.

‍

As children grow older and as technology advances, there is an increasing temptation to allow them to spend more time in front of screens than playing outside with their peers. However, it is crucial to find ways to encourage children to find time for outdoor play, as it is important for them to learn many important skills that will help with their physical, social and emotional development.

By getting into the habit of exercising at a young age and seeing it as an enjoyable experience, children are more likely to remain active as they grow older.

‍

#### **Social Development Benefits:**

‍

Playgrounds offer a great opportunity for social interaction and learning. When children are on playgrounds, they will be able to meet other children and make friends. They will also be able to learn how to play with different individuals. This will help them develop the skills they need to successfully interact with different kinds of people. Additionally, playgrounds provide children with the space they need to explore and practice socialising without much assistance from their parents. Children who attend preschool will learn essential social skills like how to communicate and cooperate with their peers, which will be beneficial in their future workplace and personal relationships.

By being exposed to such social interaction at a young age, children will mature into balanced and positive adults.

‍

Playgrounds are a crucial part of childhood development as they provide opportunities for social interaction, physical activity, and cognitive stimulation. In recent years, there has been a push for playgrounds to be more inclusive of children with special needs so that all kids can enjoy the same benefits of playing together. These types of playgrounds are specially designed to be accessible and provide valuable opportunities for children to learn about inclusivity from a young age. By blending in and playing together in the same space as the children who have special needs, they will be able to see and learn about the similarities rather than the differences. This will teach them a positive and open-minded mindset that they can carry with them throughout their lives.

‍

In addition to the main playground areas, many playgrounds also offer what are called "comfort-zone spaces" for children who either don't feel comfortable playing with a lot of other children at the same time or can't tolerate loud noises. These comfort-zone spaces provide children with invaluable social experiences by allowing them to socialise with children of all ability levels.

## **Conclusion**

‍

For children, a spontaneous playground is just as important for their development as the structured sport or gym class at their school. When children go to playgrounds on a regular basis, they learn how to develop physical, emotional, and social skills that will help them communicate better with their peers. On playgrounds, children are faced with a wide range of individuals from different backgrounds, abilities, and ages. They learn how to adapt, accept, and compromise so they can join the fun and play together.

‍

Children who frequently visit playgrounds or other play spaces are five times more likely to be a healthy weight than those who spend most of their time indoors, according to a study. Playgrounds are a perfect way for children to exercise and develop important skills that will be beneficial for their growth. The study found that playgrounds also effectively improve health overall for children.

‍

When children are playing, they're not just playing - they're also using their imagination to create their own little world that's perfect in their own eyes. And on playgrounds, they'll start to allow their friends to enter into their world too. From this, children will learn how to compromise; something that's essential for the long-term development of a well-adjusted and happy child.
