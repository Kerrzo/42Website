**The international cricket season was scheduled to take place from May to September 2020.**

15 Test matches, 49 One Day Internationals (ODIs), and 40 Twenty20 International (T20Is) are scheduled to be played during this period, as well as 8 Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and 4 Women's Twenty20 Internationals (WT20Is).

Unfortunately with the COVID-19, the decisions were made to postpone many games. In June 2020, the ICC made several interim changes to the Playing Conditions due to the pandemic.

A substitute could be used for any player showing symptoms of COVID-19, but only in a Test match. Players were banned from using saliva to shine the ball, with five penalty runs being awarded to the opposition for repeated transgressions.

And this month, the game is finally back on the track. The first match started last week. International men's cricket started with England and West Indies. They opened the season with their Test fixtures in England cricket stadiums.

## Australia T20 World Cup Officially Postponed

Sadly the cricket game won't be happening in Australia anytime sooner. ICC has confirmed that the 16-team international men's tournament scheduled for this summer in Australia has been pushed back due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/getting-back-to-playgrounds-australia-to-lift-covid-19-restriction-in-3-phases).

The tournament would move from its October-November window this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic after its latest teleconference hook-up on Monday, paving the way for the Indian Premier League to fill the void.

Australia and India remain as hosts of the next two men's T20 World Cup events but which country hosts which year is still to be determined, with the delay allowing the ICC to continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
