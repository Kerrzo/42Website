## **What You See Is What You Get**

Presentation is everything when it comes to selling your property. It goes for both physical presentation and also your digital or online presentation. Potential buyers will have more trust in properties that are well presented and photographed beautifully.

This is where Propviz can help. It’s not just still photography for your property but a visual experience for your audience.

## **What PROPVIZ Can Do For You**

### **360º Interior and Exterior Visualisation**

We are using a well-proven 3D visualization platform Matterport. It scans the room to create a 3D model of the space and gives reliable measurement.

It is Virtual Reality ready and can be viewed on all devices from desktop, tablets to mobile.

### **Aerial Videos**

Location, location and location are the buzzwords in the property market.

Aerial videos and photos allow us to give a glimpse of the property area, pointing out the different amenities in the area like transport, public schools, shopping precinct, and hospitals.
