By using an API platform, businesses can [improve customer satisfaction](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/how-augmented-reality-in-ecommerce-can-increase-customer-experience-and-engagement) and create a better overall experience for their users.

## **What is Algolia?**

Algolia's main purpose is to act as an API platform that can help speed up search and discovery on various sites and apps. It does this by consisting of two different parts - search implementation and search analytics.

The implementation tools help developers create great search experiences for users while the analytics tools help businesses understand the impact of Algolia's work and then evolve their objectives accordingly.

In other words, Algolia is constantly trying to improve the search process for both users and businesses alike!

## **What Can Algolia Provide?**

Algolia's focus on speed means that users always receive well-formatted search results instantaneously.

But Algolia is about more than just speed; it also provides a comprehensive search solution, complete with custom ranking, configuration, adaptability, tailored User Interface (UI) components for the front end, analytics, personalisation, and A/B testing.

Algolia's search engine is designed for speed and full-featured functionality. It offers:

### **Speed**

The Algolia search engine is designed for speed and optimal experience at every point in the workflow.

One of the processes is on the search requests that will always have priority over indexing operations, so it can fasten and optimise the [searching process](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/how-does-a-search-engine-work).

### **Relevance**

The Algolia engine is designed to find all records that match a query and then serve the best results to the user first.

Relevance is key in every aspect of Algolia's search experience, from structuring data to how the engine queries indices and orders results. This helps ensure that the best matches appear at the top.

Some of the advanced adjustments that can be made are:

-   Finding out if there are any typos on the search and how many.
-   Examining if the query matches the first letter, the whole word, or only partially.
-   Searching out if the word matches a synonym or not.
-   Searching out if the query matches the description or not.
-   Finding out if the item is more popular than another item.

### **Transparency**

Algolia's search engine is designed to help you easily find and rank records that are important to you and your business.

Additionally, Algolia is highly configurable, so you can customise the engine to best suit your needs.
