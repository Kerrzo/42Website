Digital transformation can be a difficult and daunting task for organisations. It can be seen as a cultural change that requires organisations to challenge the status quo and experiment more to achieve improvements. Sometimes, this can mean walking away from long-standing business processes that the organisation was built on, in favour of relatively new practices that are still being defined. However, digital [transformation](https://www.42interactive.com/) can also bring numerous benefits to organisations, such as increased efficiency, improved customer experience and greater competitive advantage.

‍

Technology is a key element in digital transformation, but it's not the only one. Other important factors include shedding outdated processes and legacy technology, and enabling innovation.

‍

Business process transformation can be thought of as a long journey. It usually starts with external factors that push a company to change and adapt to new conditions. This can be seen in the current pandemic, where the demand for digitalisation has accelerated. To meet these demands, many businesses have had to make drastic changes to their processes, which need to be carefully aligned with the company's strategy. This pressure for transformation is extremely high at the moment, and it's important for businesses to stay flexible and adaptable in order to survive.

## **What is Business Process Transformation?**

‍

Processes are an essential part of any organisation's culture and operation. However, when the environment around the organisation changes, it might create a demand for the organisation to change their business processes in order to keep up. This is done in order to ensure that the change aligns with the new business strategy, allows for innovation and growth, and reduces costs.

‍

Business process transformation is the process of optimising management processes to adapt to new business goals by involving technology. This is usually done as part of digital transformation. The term "business transformation" is a relatively new term that was first used in the fields of information technology and management [consulting](https://www.42interactive.com/services/creative-technology-consultancy). Business Process Transformation is an important step in any type of business change. There are three common types of transformations that organisations undergo: operational, core, and strategic. Operational transformation is all about making the organisation's operations and supply chain more efficient. Core transformation is about making processes more efficient through changes in operations. Strategic transformation is about shifting the focus of the organisation to a different goal.

## A Guide for Businesses - What is Digital Transformation?

‍

The Covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed the way organisations across industries operate. In order to survive and compete in this new landscape, organisations must undergo digital transformations. The success of an organisation is dependent on how well it can adapt to this change. This shift is applicable to both B2C and B2B sectors, as consumer behaviour, knowledge consumption, and processes have already changed.

‍

A study conducted in 2022 showed that the global spending on digital transformation technologies and services is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2025. The growing numbers indicate that many organisations are planning to invest in digital technologies to compete. However, there are still confusion when defining the word digital with businesses.

‍

The most common confusion is whether they are doing digitisation (the process of making something digital or converting it to a digital form), digitalisation (using digital technologies to change the business model or provide a new stream of revenue -it’s mainly focused on using online technologies and channels to become a digital business), or digital transformation (which is the process of reinvention by taking advantage of digital technologies and processes to build new systems, nurturing a digital mindset and make the most of new opportunities).

## **The Essential Guide to Digital Transformation**

‍

Digital transformation can be a challenge for organisations to define, as it means different things for different businesses. Generally, though, [digital](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, resulting in significant changes in the way an organisation does business, delivers value to customers and sees itself culturally. This means constantly challenging the status quo, experimenting more and accepting failure as part of the process. However, a digital revolution is an organisation's cultural, organisational and operational transformation through an innovative and streamlined digital transformation process. Digital transformation, more commonly shortened to DX or DDT, uses technology to create and deliver value to stakeholders (mainly clients) by allowing them to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

‍

A successful digital transformation can help organisations effectively respond to customer demands that shift quickly in the future. It can also build the needed infrastructure and the required skills that are necessary for taking advantage of rapidly evolving technologies. A [digital transformation strategy](https://www.designrush.com/agency/digital-agencies/trends/digital-transformation-strategy) also positions an organisation to survive and succeed in a future where, economically speaking, technology is the main factor.
