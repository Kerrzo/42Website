    ‍
2.  ProBuilder  
      
    ProBuilder is a plugin that enables developers to create 3D meshes directly in Unity3D. While it is not specifically designed for physics visualization and debugging, it does offer some similar functionality. For example, it allows you to see the wireframe of your game objects, which can help you identify issues with collision and physics. However, ProBuilder lacks some of the more advanced features of X-Ray Plugin, such as the ability to highlight specific objects or adjust the transparency of physics shapes.  
    ‍
3.  PhysicsDebugger3D  
      
    PhysicsDebugger3D is a plugin that enables developers to visualize and debug the physics in their Unity3D game. Like X-Ray Plugin, it allows you to see the exact physics shapes of your game objects. However, it lacks some of the advanced features of X-Ray Plugin, such as the ability to adjust the transparency of physics shapes or toggle the visibility of individual components.  
    ‍
4.  Visual Physics  
      
    Visual Physics is a plugin that enables developers to visualize the physics in their Unity3D game. It offers some similar functionality to X-Ray Plugin, such as the ability to see the physics shapes of your game objects. However, it lacks some of the advanced features of X-Ray Plugin, such as the ability to adjust the transparency of physics shapes or highlight specific objects.

Overall, while there are a number of plugins available for visualizing and debugging physics in Unity3D, X-Ray Plugin offers some of the most advanced and versatile functionality.
