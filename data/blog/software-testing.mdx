**Software Testing** is the process of verifying and determining whether products or services meet or exceed **user expectations**. Software Testing is a **process-driven approach** with specific steps to help define and attain goals.

The test process includes **design**, [development](https://www.42interactive.com/), **implementation**, and **evaluation**. It is essentially to review what Software Testing is doing well and striving to do it even better. It also means finding out what we may need to change to make sure the application meets the **needs of our users**.

Currently, there are 2 types of software testing:

## **Manual Testing**

All new features will be tested manually. It means the test is more to ensure the **Usability** of the application, e.g. all **buttons are working properly**, **feature integration** working as intended, and the flow is **user friendly**.

**Text readability** is good and there is no spill out text, the text does not truncate, no typos, and has a correct explanation. Also it has a **proper UI**, for example all **logos align**, **modules properly placed**, **correct colours**, etc.

## **Automated Testing**

Basically, the **automation testing** uses tools and these tools can be run by **scripts**, so the test can be run automatically, without **manual intervention**. The tools also can provide results of the test in the form of a **report**.

The automation test is very helpful in assisting to run tests that are **time-consuming**, for example **regression tests** or some tests that are impossible to do in an example test that may need **many users** to use the application.

Those types of tests can be done by automated tests. However, it is important to note that the automated test is just a tool, the **software testing skills** and **experience** are the key ingredient.

## **Soft skills that need mastered to become a software tester are:**

### **_Analytical skills_**

A good software tester should have sharp **analytical skills**. [Analytical](https://www.42interactive.com/about-us) skills will help break up a **complex software system** into smaller units to help gain a better understanding. These skills also help create **test cases** for complex scenarios and **analysis proficiency** gives the tester a better chance to find **glitches** inside the application or digital platform / asset.

### **_Communication skills_**

A good software tester must have good **verbal and written communication skills**. **Testing artefacts** (like test cases/plans, test strategies, bug reports, etc.) created by the software tester should be **easy to read and comprehend**. Dealing with **software developers** (in the event of bugs or any other issue) will require a shade of **discreetness** and **diplomacy**.

### ‍**_Collaborations_**

**Software Testers** are a bridge between **Developers** and **Stakeholders**. Software Testing must provide Stakeholders with **data** that measures on how ready the application is to launch and provide data on the **stability of the application** to the development team.

### ‍**_Alertness_**

**Attention to detail** is a must to become a Software Tester. Detail of the **documentation and design** provided, through to the **UI and UX** is highly recommended. **Being curious** is also important as a Software Tester.

**Software Tester intuition** is key and QA testers should try **every scenario possible** to break the software, before customers do. They should be curious about what happens next and always ask **"how about if I do this?"**.

## **Types of Testing**

There are different types of QA testing, with some examples below:

### **_Functional Testing_**

A testing to ensure that all **functions and features** of the application work properly. This test is always done by the **production team** if they make an application.

-   **Beta/Acceptance Testing** - is the **system testing** performed by a selected group of customers to determine whether to **accept or reject** the delivery of the system.
-   **End to End (e2e) Testing** – The purpose is to test the **functionality and performance** of an application under **product-like circumstances** and data to replicate **live settings**.
-   **Integration Testing** - Testing in the different **units**, **modules**, or **components** of a software application are tested as a combined entity.
-   **Regression Testing** – A test to make sure the change or update does not impact the **existing functionality**.
-   **Sanity Testing** – A test to make sure the **new changes** are implemented correctly and just focus on the new function or function that received an **enhancement or update**.
-   **Smoke Testing** – A test that is performed and focuses on the **main function**.
-   **Unit Testing** – A test of the **individual unit** of the components before integrating it into the system.

### **Non-functional Testing**

A testing to examine other aspects of how well the application works. This testing is just as critical as **functional testing** because this type of test can make the [application](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/craveable-brands-restaurants) more **usable and reliable**. **Non-functional testing** also can greatly affect the **UX**.

-   **Compliance Testing** - auditing for adherence to a **policy**, a **rule**, or a **regulation** whether the system developed meets the organisation's **prescribed standards** or not.
-   **Load Testing** – Testing to simulate the **peak use** of the application with various conditions.
-   **Performance Testing** – Test to evaluate the **responsiveness and stability** of application under a particular **workload**.
-   **Stress Testing** – Testing that verifies the **stability and reliability** of the application.
-   **Security Testing** – Test the **security** of the application.

_“Testers don’t like to break things; they like to dispel the illusion that things work”_ — Kaner, Bach, Pettichord
