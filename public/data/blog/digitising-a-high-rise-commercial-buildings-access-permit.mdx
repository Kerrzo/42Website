The completed form should be submitted to the appropriate location within the tower where work is proposed. Keep in mind that if [infrastructure](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) isolations are required for electrical or generator equipment, additional lead times will be needed for approvals and obtaining Critical Environment permit attachments.
