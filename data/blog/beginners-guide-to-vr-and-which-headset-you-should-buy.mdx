## New to VR?

Virtual reality allows people to be fully immersed in a [digitally](https://www.42interactive.com/) enhanced environment. The most common method to experience it is using ahead-mounted hardware that is able to track your movements. The VR headsets consist of a screen (some have separate screen for each eye) housed in a frame(or headset) strapped to your head. A pair of lenses are typically fixed between the panels and your eyes, blocking the view of the outside world, to make it appear that you're currently seeing through the headset to an entire new world.

In some headsets, you are able to control or select things within the simulated environment and interact with the virtual world. There's a controller that can be used in each hand to control aspects of the experience. In some cases, the controllers deliver virtual representations of your hands to manipulate the environment and objects within it in ways similar to the real world.

The modern age of [virtual reality](https://www.42interactive.com/services/immersive-xr-development) began when Palmer Luckey created the first prototype of a VR headset, which then would become the Oculus Rift. This triggers the reborn of tech industry’s interest in VR. Afterwards, Facebook’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, bought the company for 2 billion dollars a couple of years later. Since then, there have been several competitors emerging, such as HTC Vive, HP Reverb, Valve, Acer, Pico, Sony’s PlayStation VR to smartphone-powered headsets such as the do-it-yourself Google Cardboard. At the same time, numerous developers are making VR games and apps, filmmakers are exploring the potential of motion pictures for documentaries and animation, and even Facebook and YouTube have provided plenty of 360-degree videos.

From Oculus Rift to Google Daydream, VR is getting plenty of hype. Not sure which VR headset to buy? Let us be your beginner's guide to VR to help you find which VR headset to buy.

## Knowing your needs

The most important piece of equipment to get yourself into the world of virtual reality, is the VR headset. The higher quality headsets are needed to be plugged into a computer to run the apps or games, while the cheaper headsets use a smartphone in the front of the headset. There is also the middle ground where you can purchase  stand-alone, untethered headsets, which may or may not be able to plugged into a PC or similar to improve their stand alone performance.

Next, the headset needs a good quality pair of headphones, though on higher end headsets these are built in as part of the VR headset itself. You may also need hand controllers as an interaction tool inside whichever VR game or VR application you’re using, although standard gaming joypads can also be used.

VR devices also have their own app stores. These app stores are where you can browse and download the games and apps that interest you. Some of these stores are only accessible by using the device itself, while others can be browsed through your computer.

Now that we have established the basic needs of a VR headset, what should you look in a VR headset? The answer to this is it depends on many factors, including things such as cost, mobility, e.g. whether the headset needs to be connected to a PC or a stand-alone, what activities do you plan to do wit the headset.

## Which VR Headsets to Buy?

Technically, the right choice depends on what you want to do in virtual reality. Most common VR applications are games and fitness.
