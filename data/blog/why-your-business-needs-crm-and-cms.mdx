## Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Content Management Systems (CMS) serve two different purposes in the business software landscape:

CRM is all about managing customers and clients, and CMS is about managing your website.

Most businesses start with a **CMS**, especially those that need an **online portal** to showcase or sell their product or service. If your business has a website, you're already using a CMS of some sort, even if really lightweight.

A **CRM will come later** in the process, as you build your client base and need to keep better track of your **sales pipeline** and your **customer interactions** (think Salesforce). A CRM is especially useful for **B2B businesses** that need to record lots of client interactions and to follow up on leads.

If you're wondering whether your small business needs a CRM or a CMS, the answer is it probably needs both, but _when_ you need to adopt each one may vary.

You'll need a **CMS from the outset** to build your website and get your business up and running, but you won't need a CRM until you're ready to start building up your client base.

A **CMS**, or content management system, is the **central hub** where you're able to manage all of the content you publish on your website.

**CRM**, or customer relationship management, is an entirely different beast. CRM solutions organize and manage information about customers, and so are one of the **most important tools** sales and marketing teams can utilize to keep track of their leads and make sure they're communicating with their customers at the most opportune times.
