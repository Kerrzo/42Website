## Best Practices for Quality Assurance in XR

‍

Traditionally, QA is positioned as the final phase in the development process, concentrating on executing a series of test scripts to assess product quality in terms of functionality, performance, reliability, compatibility, usability, security, maintainability, and portability. However, the advent of AR, VR, and MR introduces a novel quality paradigm: immersiveness. These technologies intertwine the physical and virtual realms in innovative ways, emphasising the critical need for a truly immersive end-user experience.

‍

Before initiating any testing procedures, QA engineers should thoroughly review and familiarise themselves with the product's requirements, compiling a list of real-world experiences. This proactive approach aids in comprehending potential scenarios for user engagement and provides a comprehensive perspective on the product.

‍

#### Manual Testing

Emulating the real-world environment, setting up the play space, and utilising the full 360-degree range of scope, while measuring for performance variables and gameplay. This also involves testing camera tracking and reducing latency.

‍

#### Automated Testing

The automated testing of full-stack devices necessitates the establishment of a controlled environment, understanding testing objectives, and anticipating outcomes. Environmental variables, such as space configuration, lighting, soundproofing, power supply, temperature control, and reconfigurable spaces, must be carefully set up. Only then can tools be designed to ensure repeatable controls and consistent test runs.

‍

As [digital experiences](https://www.42interactive.com/about-us) extend into more virtual realms and objects, the design, development, and testing processes demand an approach centered on the human aspect. Given that users become integral to a system both mentally and physically, considering their feelings and goals is crucial for crafting genuinely immersive digital experiences. Unlike traditional Quality Assurance (QA), which relies on scripts, various test data, boundaries, and equivalence partitioning, testing in Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) pivots towards assessing feelings and sensations, providing conclusive feedback to developers and designers.

‍

By examining various considerations from multiple perspectives, potential issues that may not have surfaced otherwise can be uncovered. This not only enhances the quality of AR or VR products but also helps eliminate unnecessary testing and resolution cycles.

‍

## Regulations and Compliance Aspects

‍

Regulatory compliance, also called business compliance, refers to any organisation’s obedience to the laws, regulations, and other rules that govern all organisations. A regulatory requirement is a rule that a government entity imposes on an organisation. Some federal and state laws govern virtually all organisations. Regulations govern how organisations manage their business and employees and how they interact with customers, among many other areas.

‍

Digital Extended Reality (XR) technologies combine advanced computing systems (hardware and software) that can change how people connect with each other and their surroundings and influence or manipulate human actions through interactions with virtual environments.

‍

This policy brief sets out recommendations based on the regulatory priorities – including privacy and data protection, the regulation of AI and harmful online content, freedom of expression, non-discrimination, and the protection of special categories of persons, especially children. To protect and uphold ethical, legal and fundamental rights and sustainability considerations in the development and deployment of XR, encourages policy makers to:

‍

-   Promote fundamental rights and encourage the adoption of ethics-by-design approaches

-   Promote the effective enforcement, monitoring and compliance with EU laws related to XR technologies, such as the GDPR, Digital Services Act (DSA), Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the proposed AI Act.

‍

In essence, regulations are instituted to safeguard individuals, entities, and various interests, including employees, consumers, the general public, as well as the integrity of commerce and business processes.

‍

The entities overseeing regulation often focus on several primary areas, including the following:

-   Setting up and enforcing controls within organisations
-   Staying informed about and evaluating organisations' adherence to laws and regulations
-   Recognising and addressing areas where organisations fall short of compliance
-   Facilitating avenues for organisations to submit reports on their adherence to laws and regulations.
