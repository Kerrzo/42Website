## **A tried and tested digital transformation project methodology.**

‍

A well-executed project plan is crucial for the success of any [digital](https://www.42interactive.com/) project. With a clear direction and blueprint, the project will run seamlessly and efficiently. However, most digital projects unfortunately don’t start with a good plan nor a clear direction and blueprint. This often leads to confusion and a lack of direction, which can cause the project to fail.  

The most common problems we encountered are these three:

-   No clear direction on what the digital project is or not knowing the requirements.

-   No defined timeline and budget.

-   Choosing wrongly design service or technology providers.

‍

This reminded us of this scene in **The Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy.**

‍

‍

Here we see Deepthought machine or computer spits out 42 as the answer to the ultimate question. But the machine itself knows that the ones asking the ultimate question, didn’t understand the true meaning of the question itself.

Often, the project owner or the person who came up with the initial idea for the project doesn't really know what they want. They don't understand what they're asking for and end up just throwing questions out there to get an answer, any answer. What they need to keep in mind is that more important than getting any answer is getting the right answer; an answer that will help them move closer to their goal.

‍

Therefore, we created a proven methodology to give any digital [transformation](https://www.42interactive.com/about-us) project a proper blueprint, because we know how important it is to have all the right questions answered from the beginning. A methodology that will identify the questions and distil them to get the essence of the project and create a solid blueprint that will help anyone working on the project to have a clear vision and unified mission for the end goal. We call this methodology **“Digital Deepthought Process”.**

‍

## **What is Digital Deepthought Process?**

‍

A methodology we created and is used in our design and technology partnerships with our clients. This is a packaged service with a set cost that focuses on effective workshops to create reports and blueprints at the beginning of the project. These reports and blueprints can then be utilised as a brief for us or any other service providers that you prefer.

‍

This process helps us to create a better understanding of the project from the start, which in turn allows us to deliver the best possible results for our clients.

‍

Digital Deepthought Process consists of the following packaged services that you can mix and match according to what you need:
