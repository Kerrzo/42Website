**Web application quality assurance** is a critical aspect of the **software development process** and one that is often overlooked. If a developer misses a small detail in the **programming code**, the program will not run efficiently and the users will not be able to use it.

From the perspective of **localisation**, it is important to ensure that any text entered into the system can be displayed properly in the **target language**.

‍

## What is a Web Application?

‍

A **web application** is a type of app that can be accessed through a **web browser**. When accessed in a browser on a **mobile device**, web apps look and behave like mobile apps — but they aren't the same.

A **web app** is an application program that is stored on a **remote server** and delivered over the internet through a **browser interface**. **Web services** are web apps by definition and many, although not all, websites contain web apps.

‍

[Developers](https://www.42interactive.com/) design **web applications** for many different reasons, such as for an organization or an individual. Some common web applications are ones that people use every day, like **webmail** or **online calendars**. Others are only accessible by users with a **specific browser**. However, most web apps can be accessed by most **common browsers**.

## How Do Web Applications Work?

‍

A web app needs a **web server**, **application server** and **database** to operate. The **web server** manages requests from clients, while the **application server** completes the requested task. A **database** stores any necessary information.

It does not need to be downloaded since it is accessed through a **network via browsers**. In general, a web app can be accessed by anyone via browsers such as **Google Chrome**, **Mozilla Firefox** or **Safari**.

‍

## How Do You Test a Web Application?

‍

Below are the most common techniques in the world of QA when testing a web application:

‍

#### **Functionality Testing**

The main goal of **functional testing** is to make sure that all **features of a web application** work correctly and without any problems. Functional testing for a web application may involve checking that all **links work**, **testing cookies**, investigating **forms on all web pages**, assessing **database security**, and verifying **CSS or HTML**.

It is also important for developers and testers to make sure that **test cases** include important **boundary conditions**. In addition, there should be an **error message** for any **invalid input**.

‍

#### **Web UI Testing**

There are several critical components to a web app, including the **web server interface**, **database server interface**, and **application server interface**. **Web UI testing** is an important way to validate that all components of the web app are working well together.

Testers should use this testing method to determine whether the **interaction between the various servers** is carried out effectively.

‍

#### Usability Testing

The application's **user interface** should be **effective and user-friendly**. It is also important to adhere to **global conventions** and **web standards** while developing a web application. **Usability testing** is appropriate for apps that aim to **automate manual processes**.

However, testers must consider critical issues such as **navigation**, a **site map**, and avoiding **over-crowded content** while performing usability testing.

‍

#### Performance Testing

**Performance testing** is a process that helps you understand how a web application will respond to **real-world usage scenarios**. This testing can include **stress testing**, **load testing**, and **scalability testing**.

By running tests on different **hardware platforms**, **operating systems**, and more, performance testing provides valuable insights into how a website will function under **real-world conditions**.

‍

#### Compatibility Testing

**Compatibility** is key when testing a web application. By running **compatibility tests**, you can ensure that your web app will work well with different **operating systems**, **browsers**, **mobile devices**, and other printing options.

By doing this, you can avoid potential **compatibility issues** that could occur down the line.

‍

#### Security Testing

**Security testing** is a critical **web app automation testing method** as it determines whether **data modifications or leaks** are tolerable. It primarily includes various activities such as verifying **SSL**, checking the **CAPTCHA** for automated script logins, and determining whether **web files or directories** can be accessed directly.

By running security tests, you can help ensure that your web application is **secure and protected** against **data breaches** and other threats.

## Benefits of QA and Testing for Web Applications

‍

The involvement of the QA team during the testing phase of web app development offers several advantages.

‍

First, it ensures that the **final product** is of **high quality** and free of any **technical issues**. Users can then use the app immediately upon release without having to experience any problems. Additionally, this involvement guarantees a **highly efficient product** with a high **customer satisfaction index**.

‍

Second, to ensure that the **completed web app** is **fully functional**. By **detecting bugs early on**, the QA team can help [improve](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) the **efficiency and speed** of **new feature releases**.

‍

Third, to ensure that the **released website** is of **high quality** and meets **customer expectations**. By running a **rigorous test** during the development phase, the QA team can identify **potential defects** and **technical issues**, thereby making the product more **stable and reliable**. This in turn builds **customer confidence** in the application.

‍

Finally, an **automated test** can be a great **testing tool** when testing a web app. By **automating some of the testing processes**, you can **save time** and ensure that your QA team is focused on the **most important aspects** of the project. In addition, automating your tests can help ensure a **positive return on investment**.

## Best Practices for QA Testing in Web Applications

‍

**Quality assurance** is crucial for delivering **high-quality products**. However, there are some key **best practices** and **testing activities** that must be taken into consideration as part of the QA process.

For example, when testing a product, it is important to consider the **user experience** and ensure that the product is **easy to use**. Additionally, it is important to test for **functionality** and **compatibility** with other products.

‍

#### QA Team's Involvement Before Kick off

It is still quite common to see cases where **QA is only brought in late** in the development process as if they're only needed for testing before deployment or release. This can be a **recipe for disaster**.

**QA needs to be included** as part of the development team from the beginning. The mindset should be to **test early and often**. This has been proven to be the best way to keep **product development on track** while also ensuring that **business requirements** are met and **performance issues** are avoided early.

‍

#### Functionality Testing

**QA teams** have a lot of responsibility when it comes to making sure a [web app](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/international-towers-digital-ecosystems) is ready to be deployed. They need to check all the different **components of the app**, including **links**, **forms**, and **workflows**, to make sure everything is working correctly.

QA teams also make **recommendations** for how the process can be improved in future developments.

**User experience** is important for all elements of the app. That is why **every element matters** for QA.

‍

#### Stress Testing

It's great when an app works well. However, it's even more important that it can **perform well under heavy load conditions**. **Stress testing** can help reveal **potential issues** that could cause an app to crash.

By running a **load test**, we can learn about these conditions and address them to make the app more **stable** in future versions.

‍

#### Ensure Compatibility

Different people have different **favourite browsers**, and it's important that your app can **run smoothly on all of them**. By making sure your app is **responsive** on the most commonly used browsers, you can provide the **best possible user experience** and prevent **technical issues** from happening when users from all over the world try to access it.

‍

#### Usability Testing

There are several key factors that go into making a **successful app**. Firstly, it must be **easy to use**; users should be able to **navigate the app** with ease and without difficulty. Secondly, it is important to meet **quality requirements**; the app should be well-made and meet the needs of the user.

Lastly, any **features in the app** must be useful; they should serve a purpose and add to the **overall experience** of using the app. If these key points are met, then the app stands a good chance of being successful.

‍

#### Collaborate with QA Team

**Quality assurance** is vital to any project's success. By **involving the QA team from the beginning** and ensuring that everyone shares the same vision, we can improve the **quality of the final product**. Everyone on the team must be aware of the **testing process** and how it fits into the larger picture.

By bringing everyone together on this initiative, we can make the testing process more **efficient and more productive**.

**Communication** is key during the **software development process**, especially between the **Quality Assurance team** and the **product managers**. QA needs to have a good understanding of the **requirements for the end user** in order to create successful results.

By keeping the **lines of communication open**, it will help ensure a **successful development cycle**.
