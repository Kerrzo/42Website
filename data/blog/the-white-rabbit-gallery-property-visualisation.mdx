**Have you ever wondered that a 3D scanning technology can bring out the best of art and to preserve the beauty of it?**

‍

[The White Rabbit art gallery](https://whiterabbitcollection.org/) is a premier destination for anyone interested in 21st-century Chinese contemporary art. With over 3000 works by 700 different artists, the collection offers something for everyone. The gallery was founded by Judith Neilson, who was inspired to establish it after her first trips to Beijing in the late 1990s. She was thrilled by the idea of a society that is so different from what she had seen in Australia.

‍

It was opened in 2009 to display a significant collection of contemporary Chinese art. Dedicated to 21st century artworks, it features Chinese contemporary art and has a solid emotional connection with its visitors. The showcases at the gallery will change every season to feature unique topics, and the building's structure will also be adapted to fit the needs of each new exhibit. This means that visitors can expect to see something new and different every time they come to the museum.

‍

When we scanned the gallery, we had to be careful of our visibility and reflections, as well as the access, lighting, and individual needs of each piece of art. With careful planning and execution, we were able to successfully complete the 3D scan and preserve the beauty of the gallery for years to come.

‍

We used Matterport, a popular 3D scanning software to scan the gallery and each piece of art. Matterport is a [technology](https://www.42interactive.com/) platform that allows for the creation of 3D digital models of physical spaces using a specialised camera and software.

‍

Here are some potential benefits of using Matterport:

‍

-   **Virtual tours**: Matterport's 3D digital models can be used to create immersive [virtual tours](https://www.42interactive.com/services/immersive-xr-development) of physical spaces, which can be particularly useful for real estate listings, vacation rentals, or businesses that want to showcase their facilities.
-   **Increased engagement**: By providing an interactive and immersive experience, Matterport models may help increase engagement with potential customers or clients. This could lead to higher conversion rates, sales, or bookings.
-   **Remote accessibility**: Matterport's 3D models can be accessed remotely, which may be particularly useful for businesses with a global or remote workforce, or for people who are unable to visit a physical location in person.
-   **Cost and time savings**: Using Matterport to create digital models of physical spaces may be more cost-effective and time-efficient than traditional methods of creating 3D models, such as laser scanning or photogrammetry.
-   **Accurate measurements**: Matterport's models include accurate measurements of physical spaces, which may be useful for architects, engineers, or construction professionals who need precise measurements for planning or design purposes.

In 2022 we also helped the White Rabbit art [gallery](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/the-white-rabbit-gallery) with their 2 exhibitions:

"[**Big in China**](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=BD5YzDArXtb)"

‍

Making it big in an Eastern country used to be a second choice for Western rockstars. Despite its multitude, the Chinese opinion was once considered inferior to established Western tastes. Yet China’s fast-paced transformation has turned the nation into a global powerhouse. These days companies, brands, and even nations from around the world all scramble to win the favour of Chinese consumers.

‍

These artworks explain that China is a country that has undergone dramatic changes in the past few decades. It has evolved from an Eastern country with inferior technology and tastes to a Western one. The Chinese population has become more and more globalised, which means that its culture and tastes are now on par with those of other countries around the world.

‍

The Chinese consumer landscape is now dominated by companies, brands and even nations from around the world vying for their attention.

**"**[**I Loved You**](https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=955EFBSfYFF)**"**

‍

"I Loved You" is a collection of artwork by Chinese artists. The series explores different aspects of our intimate lives, from the mundane to the sublime.

‍

The time between messages, the length between reunions, the distance between lovers – our intimate lives are filled with spaces. Whether they be passionate or painful, absences punctuate our daily routines with reminders of a beloved when they are no longer there. From heady first meetings to bittersweet goodbyes, throughout it all, love haunts us like a ghost.

‍

Where have we looked for love? The artists in I Loved You explore the many places we look for love. Qiu Jiongjiong takes us to an underground bar in Beijing where people sing songs of longing. Gao Rong recreates the warmth of her grandparents’ home with needle and thread, making the brick look soft like a favourite sweater. For Hu Weiyi, the trace of love lingers for a moment on his partner's skin. For Jiang Zhi, its memory burns brightly like a flower caught ablaze. For Wang Quanzhang, its scent lingers.
