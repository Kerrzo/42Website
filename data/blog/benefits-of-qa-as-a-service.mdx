Software Quality Assurance (QA) is an integrated part of Software Industry.

‍

A quality assurance analyst main focus is to identify all issues that have been overlooked during the tight deadline in software life cycle, such as between production and deployment phases. The majority of industries could have a team of programming specialists working under heavy pressure and spend extra hours to make the application is ready to be released.

‍

However, when delivering the application, it may be seen as a low-quality product even before the programmer begins typing their first line of code.

  
There are many approaches that can be applied to have a [successful software development](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/the-importance-of-qa-in-software-development) and delivery. One of which that is important to have and has been proven able to achieve that success across many [customers engagement](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/how-augmented-reality-in-ecommerce-can-increase-customer-experience-and-engagement) is by having a **Quality Assurance**.

They are the key elements that outlines and maintains the standards and ensures that both knowledge and practices are recorded and shared thoroughly across many departments in the production division.

### **Success Stories**

‍

**Developing an administrative site for a large Commercial property portfolio**  
  
‍

We had the opportunity to create an administration site from scratch on a large Commercial property in Australia. The site will be complex, with features ranging from registration to payments and security. We need to not only build these features but also assure their quality. That's where QA comes in, making sure everything works properly and meets the client's expectations. QA will also create documentation to guide the client on how to use the site.

‍

**Re-building the digital site of Australia’s big chicken brand**

‍

We've been working on a few things like managing data, creating features, and building mobile applications for a [big brand fried chicken franchise](https://www.42interactive.com/projects/craveable-online-ordering-system-project). We're in charge of re-building the site and merging the order and brand sites into one. This includes dealing with payments, maintaining data, etc. Plus, our QA team is responsible for making sure the quality is up to par before we hand it back to the client. We need to make sure the integration between the new site and the application is working properly.

## **Conclusion**

‍

Technology is being developed at an unprecedented rate and has become a integral part of our lives. New software development trends are being rapidly adopted and applied to create better or new technology products. The success of any software product (web app, mobile app, stand-alone app, etc.) is greatly reliant on the quality and user experience it can provide. In the software development life cycle, there is typically a mandatory phase of testing before the product is released to the general public.

‍

Unfortunately, many software companies make the mistake of thinking that the software they've developed will run perfectly without any errors. This can cause big problems down the line when things don't go as smoothly as planned. To make matters worse, many businesses see the testing phase and QA as unnecessary and often cut corners or skip this stage entirely to save on costs.

‍

Quality assurance is a key element of successful software development and delivery. It establishes and maintains standards, and ensures that knowledge and practices are recorded and shared thoroughly across departments in production. Quality assurance is important to have because it has been proven able to achieve success across many customer engagements.

‍

The software testing phase is not just about testing the product. It's about increasing your business value. QA's focus is on process and problem solving, not just on providing test results. QA is the role of testers, but also of those who solve problems.
