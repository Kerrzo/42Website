## How Does it Work?

While we are aware that virtual reality is a wonderful tool, how does it work? Virtual reality headsets are normally comprised of a pair of thick goggles connected to a computer and equipped with a set of controllers that enable the user to perform actions.

Having said that, there are also advanced headsets that feature eye tracking without the use of controllers, as well as standalone consoles that do not require a connection to a computer. Additionally, there are less expensive headsets in the form of [cardboard goggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cardboard) that link to your phone.

### Movement

The enchantment of virtual reality is based on the headset's capacity to track the user's head and eye movement and adjust the perspective accordingly. Additionally, headsets can measure your body movement, which enables you to walk within the simulated world.

This 3D tracking capability is not suitable for everyone, as motion sickness can be a side effect of operating these sophisticated pieces of equipment. Fortunately, the controllers may also be used to navigate the surroundings.

### Vision

You may be wondering how these basic pairs of goggles are capable of drastically altering your environment. This is accomplished by the creation of a three-dimensional perspective. This works well because stereopsis, the capacity to visualise a three-dimensional shape using visual information from both eyes, is involved. Your right and left eyes see things somewhat differently, and these two perspectives combine to produce the same impact as how we perceive things in daily life.

Two distinct images, one for each eye, are presented on either side of the goggles, and these images are displayed at the ideal distance from your eyes to produce a sense of depth. Because we perceive photographs and smartphone displays as flat visuals, they will never have the same effect as a three-dimensional simulation.

Sound is another critical component of creating a truly immersive experience, which is why no VR headset is complete without the addition of headphones – which are frequently built-in to VR Headsets.
