#### How do we make better SEO with Contentful and Next.js Framework in Red Rooster Website?

‍

**Craveable Brands** is a Franchisor company that owns three iconic Australian food brands: **Red Rooster**, **Oporto**, and **Chicken Treat**. In this project, we focus on the development of the **Red Rooster website**. Those who are unfamiliar with Red Rooster, it is an Australian chain of fast-food restaurants that specializes in roast chicken. It was founded in 1972 and has over **360 locations** across Australia.

‍

Red Rooster's website has **two separate sites** - one for the brand ([https://redrooster.com.au](https://redrooster.com.au)) and one for ordering ([https://orders.redrooster.com.au](https://orders.redrooster.com.au)). Each website is built with different technology; the brand site uses **WordPress**, and the ordering site uses **React.js Framework**.

The brand site has no problem with **SEO** because it was built with WordPress, which is an engine with **full SEO support**. However, for the Ordering site, **SEO is the main concern** because it was created with React.js, which is not supported by SEO. Therefore, in this project, we are hoping to join the **Brand site** and **Ordering site** into one single website that will be recognised by **search engines**.

‍

We need to find a balance between **performance** and **SEO friendliness** as we move our existing website over to **Next.js**. There is a lot of research that needs to be done in order to make sure that we are **porting the website logic** correctly, as the new technology is very different from what we are using now.

‍

We helped our client to fix the **SEO problem** by merging the **Brand sites** and **Ordering sites** into a single website. This website was developed with a combination between **Contentful** and **Next.js**. With Contentful we focused on managing the **website content** including SEO, and Next.js for **mapping the content** and **rendering the website content** from Contentful.

‍

At the beginning of development, we create a **website component** using **Storybook**. In Storybook, we can see how the component looks and change its content. In parallel, we also prepare the **Contentful structure** and designed the **Next.js structure**.

This allows us to have a **clear picture** of how the website will look before we start coding.

‍

We used **Contentful** to build the Merge website, which allows us to **edit the site's content directly**. Any changes we publish in Contentful will **automatically update** on the Merge site. We've also wrapped the **store's menu** in Contentful, so we can change additional information like **nutritional details** directly from Contentful.
