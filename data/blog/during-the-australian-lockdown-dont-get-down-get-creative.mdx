The Australian lockdown has been a difficult time for many people, as they navigate unprecedented challenges and disruptions to their daily routines. While it's important to stay informed and take necessary precautions to stay safe and healthy, it's equally important to find ways to stay positive and maintain a sense of normalcy during these trying times.

One way to do that is by getting creative!

In fact, creativity can have a range of benefits during lockdown. Not only can it help reduce stress and promote mental health, but it can also improve productivity and foster a sense of community and connection.

In this article, we'll explore some of the creative activities you can try during lockdown, as well as tips for staying motivated and inspired.

## Benefits of Creativity During Lockdown

The lockdown can take a toll on mental health and wellbeing, with many people feeling anxious, stressed, and isolated. Engaging in creative activities can help alleviate these feelings and provide a positive outlet for self-expression.

In fact, research has shown that creative activities can help lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, as well as promote positive emotions and feelings of wellbeing.

Beyond the mental health benefits, creativity can also help improve productivity and engagement. When we're engaged in a creative task, we're often fully absorbed and in a state of flow, which can help us stay focused and energized.

Additionally, creative activities can provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can help boost motivation and self-confidence.

Finally, creativity can foster a sense of community and connection, even while we're physically apart. Sharing our creative projects with others can help us feel more connected and part of something larger than ourselves.

## Creative Activities to Try During Lockdown

Now that we’ve covered the benefits of creativity during lockdown, let’s explore some creative activities you can try.

### A. Artistic Pursuits

Whether you’re an experienced artist or a beginner, now is the perfect time to unleash your creativity and explore your artistic side. Painting, drawing, and sculpting are all great ways to express yourself and relax during lockdown. You can choose to create your own masterpiece or follow along with an online tutorial to learn new techniques.

### B. Crafting and DIY Projects

If you enjoy working with your hands, crafting and DIY projects are a great way to stay busy and get creative during lockdown. Knitting, crocheting, and sewing are popular choices, but you can also try woodworking, jewelry making, or even upcycling old furniture.

### C. Creative Writing and Journaling

Writing is a great way to express your thoughts and feelings and can be particularly helpful during challenging times. Whether you prefer to write fiction, poetry, or personal essays, there are plenty of resources and online communities to help you improve your writing skills and get feedback on your work.

Journaling is also a popular way to get creative and reflect on your thoughts and experiences during lockdown. You can use a notebook, bullet journal, or even a digital app to record your daily thoughts and feelings.

### D. Cooking and Experimenting with New Recipes

Being stuck at home doesn’t mean you have to eat the same boring meals every day. Use this time to experiment with new recipes and try new cuisines. You can also challenge yourself to cook with ingredients you already have at home and see what delicious dishes you can come up with.

### E. Virtual Learning and Exploration

Just because you can’t physically travel doesn’t mean you can’t explore new places and learn new things. Many museums, galleries, and historical sites offer virtual tours and online exhibits, and there are plenty of online courses and webinars to help you learn new skills and expand your knowledge.

## Tips for Staying Motivated and Inspired

While getting started with a creative project is often the hardest part, staying motivated and inspired can also be a challenge. Here are some tips to help you stay on track:

### A. Setting Achievable Goals and Deadlines

It’s important to set realistic goals for your creative projects and break them down into smaller, achievable tasks. Setting deadlines can also help keep you accountable and motivated to keep going.

### B. Taking Breaks and Practicing Self-Care

It’s easy to get swept up in your creative projects and forget to take breaks. But taking regular breaks and practicing self-care can help you avoid burnout and stay motivated over the long-term. Take time to relax, exercise, and connect with loved ones.

### C. Finding Inspiration in Everyday Life and Surroundings

Creativity can come from anywhere, so keep an open mind and look for inspiration in the world around you. Take a walk in nature, try a new hobby, or simply observe the people and objects in your home.

### D. Connecting with Others and Sharing Creative Projects

Connecting with others who share your interests can be a great way to stay motivated and get feedback on your creative projects. Join online communities or share your work with friends and family to get support and encouragement.

## Conclusion

During these uncertain times, it’s more important than ever to stay positive and find ways to stay engaged and inspired. Whether you’re an experienced artist or just starting to explore your creative side, there are plenty of ways to get creative during lockdown.

By trying new activities, setting achievable goals, and practicing self-care, you can stay motivated and keep your spirits up even when times are tough.

So why not try something new today and see where your creativity takes you?
