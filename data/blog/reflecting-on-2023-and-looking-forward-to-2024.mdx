#### ‍**International Towers' Amica**

**‍**

Over the past five years, International Towers has been our valued client. We designed a [digital ecosystem](https://www.42interactive.com/services/digital-design-and-development) to efficiently manage the property. This year, we rebranded the digital product as Amica, a term that translates to "friend" in Latin. Following the rebrand, we introduced Amica Perks, a community engagement program that empowers International Towers to provide additional benefits to tenants. These benefits include exclusive offers from participating retailers and redeemable rewards.

‍

We integrated an additional feature into Amica, allowing the management team to create perks for tenants. Tenants can redeem these perks, revealing a QR code, which retail partners can then scan to confirm the claim—all within the same app and digital ecosystem. The launch was a resounding success, adding 1000 more users to Amica, and engagement is at an all-time high. As their creative and tech partner, we are thrilled and proud to contribute to the rebranding of this established digital platform, propelling it to new heights.

#### ‍**International Towers' ESG**

**‍**

In addition to the Amica rebrand launch, we assisted International Towers in developing an interactive page dedicated to their Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) commitments. This informative and engaging page aims to align all tenants, including the management team and service partners, with a comprehensive understanding of their ESG commitments. Given the complexity and multi-layered nature of the information, which involves numerous connections between different elements, our creative team has done an exceptional job in effectively presenting this intricate information on a single interactive page.

‍

In addition to the Deliverect integration, we have implemented user authentication using Amazon Cognito, a robust platform capable of handling a large number of users with various scenarios effectively.

#### **The White Rabbit Gallery**

The White Rabbit Gallery in Sydney Australia, is a contemporary Chinese art gallery and features incredible Chinese artworks; is a haven for art enthusiasts and cultural connoisseurs. This year, 42 Interactive had the privilege once again to create the gallery's 3D visualisation, capturing the essence of two remarkable exhibitions: “[Shuo Shu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtoLVN5qQ9k&t=3s)” and “[I Am The People](https://youtu.be/HBs_IaobrfQ)”. These projects were rewarding. We were able to show the beauty and creativity of the exhibitions to more people digitally. The 3D scan was quite challenging, from navigating the circular layouts of "Shuo Shu" to handling the reflective surfaces of "I Am The People". Each scan showed the gallery's commitment to preserving art in all its forms and making it available to the public for free bot offline and online.

#### **SXSW Sydney**

**‍**

This year, we hosted the first-ever South by Southwest (SXSW) Sydney conference, blending creativity and technology with a diverse lineup of speakers and professionals from Australia and around the world. The event received mixed reviews. While it was enjoyable for a first-time occurrence, there were concerns about session scheduling, with sessions feeling overly packed and making it challenging to create a clear calendar for optimal content enjoyment.

‍

The conference featured numerous AI talks, including intriguing practical uses like AI crafting a beer from recipe to process. However, some sessions lacked dynamism, with industry professionals discussing concepts without showcasing practical work, resulting in dull presentations. As is customary, many industry professionals utilised the event primarily as a marketing tool for their products and services.

‍

Looking ahead, there is optimism for improvement next year, and the hope is that organisers will be more stringent in content and speaker selection to enhance the overall experience.

#### **What's Ahead**

**‍**

As we look towards 2024, the landscape of the creative and technology space is poised for transformative changes, particularly for digital agencies like ours that operate across multiple international markets. Our experience, especially in Australia and the United States, has provided us with invaluable insights into the evolving needs of our clients and the dynamic nature of digital solutions. As we expand into new territories like Indonesia and Japan, these insights will be crucial in tailoring our approach to meet diverse cultural and business expectations.

‍

In 2024, we anticipate a significant shift towards more integrated and immersive digital experiences. This evolution is driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and augmented reality technologies. As a leader in this space, our focus will be on harnessing these technologies to create more personalised and engaging experiences for our clients' audiences. In Australia, where the digital market is mature, we will push the boundaries of innovation, aiming to set new industry standards. In the United States, where the market is vast and diverse, our strategy will involve leveraging data analytics and AI to better understand and cater to specific regional preferences.

‍

Entering markets like Indonesia and Japan presents both challenges and opportunities. These regions are rapidly growing in their digital capabilities and consumer expectations. In Indonesia, there's a growing appetite for mobile-first solutions, influenced by the country's high mobile penetration rate. Our strategy will involve creating mobile-centric solutions and platforms that resonate with the local audience. Meanwhile, in Japan, where the blend of tradition and technology is unique, our approach will focus on creating digital experiences that respect cultural nuances while introducing innovative tech solutions.

‍

Overall, 2024 will be a year of expanding our global footprint, deepening our technological expertise, and continuously adapting to the ever-changing digital landscape. As a leader in this space, our commitment is to not only stay ahead of the curve but also to shape the future of digital interactions in each market we enter.
