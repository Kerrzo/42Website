**This year is marking the first ten years of the** [**White Rabbit Gallery**](https://www.42interactive.com/blog/the-white-rabbit-gallery-property-visualisation)**.**

THEN celebrates the great adventure of White Rabbit’s first decade: ten exciting years of showcasing the creative energy, daring, and technical accomplishment of Chinese contemporary art.

The gallery’s tenth-anniversary exhibition presents works by more than 60 artists, all produced during the first ten years of Judith Neilson’s private collection (2000-2010).

THEN tells the story of White Rabbit’s first, boldly adventurous decade – a journey into the unknown that parallels the ambition and audacity of contemporary Chinese art.
