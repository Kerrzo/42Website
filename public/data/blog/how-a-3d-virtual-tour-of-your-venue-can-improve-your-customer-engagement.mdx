You can do so many things to improve guest engagement in your hospitality venue. One of the coolest ways today is by using a 3D virtual tour. This technology allows guests to visit a venue without going to the location. They can check the ambience, style, menu, and many other elements you have to offer before booking.

Check out the way a virtual tour can improve your guest engagement.

## **Show a Realistic Vision of Your Venue**

One of the great benefits of offering a 3D virtual tour is that guests can get a realistic vision of your hospitality venue. They can see and feel the ambience, decorations and designs, menu items, seating configuration, and even food. Take the [Peanut Butter Jelly Restaurant](https://www.peanutbutterjelly.com.au/), in Manly, Sydney as an example,  this restaurant uses a 3D virtual walkthrough service from [Propviz](https://propviz.com.au/). The owners want to show the combination between street art and street food to guests.  
  
The venue has 5 zones with different themes. A 3D virtual tour helps the owners to show the experience without asking guests to come to the location first. Guests can see and feel the atmosphere of the venue and get an overview of one of the zones in the restaurant. Guests even get a brief explanation about the creator and its specialization.

The more realistic the theme, the more depth the guests can see and feel, and the greater the opportunity to book a seat in the restaurant. The venue doesn’t need to explain the concept and idea of the venue and a 3D virtual tour increases guests’ curiosity about the restaurant and many of them may reserve a table once they finish the virtual tour.

## **Introduce Special Features** 

Venue owners can also use a 3D virtual tour to introduce special or new features. You can link a video that shows the warm and welcoming interior to the guests. At [Peanut Butter Jelly](https://www.peanutbutterjelly.com.au/), Propviz can show guests the Asian, North American, and Caribbean menu and atmosphere while using the Matterport 3D virtual tour. 

This venue can also introduce street art that guests can enjoy when they take a Matterport virtual tour in this restaurant. Guests get additional information that this feature was created by a Brooklyn artist (Madsteez) and his achievements. Guests can explore the restaurant first before deciding the best zone they want to reserve. 

Another benefit of a 3D virtual tour is that guests only have to see the virtual map and click on the zone they want to see. A sophisticated Matterport camera helps to transfer the real design of the venue into a dollhouse. 

## **Connect to People Easily** 

Nowadays, people often find information about a venue they want to visit via Google Street View and Maps. These online platforms are powerful enough to engage guests to come to your venue.

So, what is the relationship between 3D virtual tour services and these platforms?

People will be curious about the sensation of exploring your venue virtually. Indeed, they have a desire to feel the atmosphere, facilities and other areas once they get a great experience after the tour. 

## **Show the Great Aspects of the Venue**

In the case of Peanut Butter Jelly Restaurant, guests will see the types of chairs, tables, glassware, plates, and other things through a 3D virtual tour. Guests only have to click on the sign to find out the information about the room if they want, they can even zoom in or out of the location to see the detail closely or check the overall design. 

3D walkthrough services are easy to view and navigate. People only need to use their mouse or finger to tab the tools they want to use. That’s it! They can enjoy the virtual tour before finally deciding to make a booking, reserve a space or purchase.

## **Show that Your Business is Up to Date with Technology**

## **Augment Your Google My Business (GMB) Page** 

Virtual Tours are compatible with a variety of platforms, therefore you can upload the 3D virtual tour in Google Maps or Google Street View, but also into the Google My Business Page platform. Having a virtual tour on your Google My Business Page (GMB) enhances and augments engagement compared to venues without such virtual tour, video or 360 photo content.

Thus increasing the opportunity further to you to get more guests, bookings and revenue if you are higher up in the webpage search result.  

## **Providing People with Insight and Experience**
